## Overview
This topic explains how to archive flags you no longer need, or delete flags that are archived.

When a flag is no longer being served to users, and it is not a prerequisite of other flags, it may be time to archive it. Archiving a flag retires it from LaunchDarkly without deleting it. You can restore an archived flag if you need it, or find it to reference its configuration later. 

LaunchDarkly will not let you archive a flag that is a prerequisite of other flags. Flags are good candidates for archival when they are serving only one variation in the environment you choose and have not been requested in the last 7 days.

You can delete an archived flag after you determine that it will no longer be needed in your project.

## Archiving flags
To archive a flag:

1. Navigate to the flag dashboard.  
2. Find the flag you wish to archive and click **Archive**. The "Archive this flag?" screen appears. If the flag has dependencies, you cannot archive it. To learn how to resolve flag dependencies, read [Resolving dependencies](#resolving-dependencies).

3. Choose the environments your team or customers depend on to confirm you can archive the flag from those environments without unintended consequences. Verify that the flag is not in use by reviewing its states in the flag archive fields.

You cannot archive flags that are prerequisites of other flags. If you attempt to archive a prerequisite flag, the "Archive this flag?" screen prevents you from doing so.

If the flag is a prerequisite of other flags, you cannot archive it. You must remove the flag as a prerequisite before you can archive it.

Other dependencies will not stop you from archiving a flag, but we recommend resolving all dependencies before you archive a flag. 

These dependencies are:
* The flag is serving multiple variations
* The flag has been requested in the last 7 days

## Deleting archived flags
After you archive a flag, you can delete it if you no longer need it. 

If you delete a flag, its rules will be deleted. Should it be requested again, the flag value defined in code will be returned for all users. Remove any references to the feature flag from your application code before you delete it.
<Callout intent="alert">
  <Callout.Title>Deleted flags are gone forever</Callout.Title>

</Callout>
To delete an archived flag:

1. Click on the **edit menu** button (three vertical dots) next to the **Flag +** button.
2. Click on the **View archived flags** dropdown. The "Archived feature flags" screen appears.
