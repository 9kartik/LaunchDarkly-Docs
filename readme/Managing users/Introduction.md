This category has documentation topics about LaunchDarkly users. Users are people or entities who encounter feature flags in your product. They appear in the Users dashboard after they are identified by a LaunchDarkly SDK.

You can manage the way users interact with feature flags, and which users encounter which flags, by targeting flags to user attributes or segments. You can even choose which users to include or exclude in the user data you collect.

Read the content in this category to understand everything about how LaunchDarkly feature flags impact users of your product.
