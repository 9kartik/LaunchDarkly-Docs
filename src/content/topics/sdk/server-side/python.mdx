This reference guide documents all of the methods available in our Python SDK, and explains in detail how these methods work. If you want to dig even deeper, our SDKs are open source. To learn more, read [Python SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/python-server-sdk). The online [Python API docs](https://launchdarkly-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/) contain the programmatic definitions of every class and method. Additionally you can clone and run a [sample application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-python) using this SDK. For an example of using the Python SDK inside an R application see [hello-r](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-r).

## Getting started

Building on top of our [Getting Started guide](/home/getting-started), the following steps will get you started with using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Python application.

The first step is to install the LaunchDarkly SDK as a dependency in your application using your application's dependency manager. Refer to the [SDK releases page](https://github.com/launchdarkly/python-server-sdk/releases) to identify the latest version if you want to depend on a specific version.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Shell', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```bash
pip install launchdarkly-server-sdk
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Next you should import the LaunchDarkly client in your application code.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
import ldclient
from ldclient.config import Config
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Once the SDK is installed and imported, you'll want to create a single, shared instance of `ldclient`. The `get()` function enforces the singleton pattern; you should only have one instance of the client in your application. You should specify your SDK key here so that your application will be authorized to connect to LaunchDarkly and for your application and environment.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
ldclient.set_config(Config("YOUR_SDK_KEY"))
ld_client = ldclient.get()
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Using `ld_client`, you can check which variation a particular user should receive for a given feature flag.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
show_feature = ld_client.variation("your.flag.key", {"key": "user@test.com"}, False)

if show_feature:
  # application code to show the feature
else:
  # the code to run if the feature is off
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Lastly, when your application is about to terminate, shut down `ld_client`. This ensures that the client releases any resources it is using, and that any pending analytics events are delivered to LaunchDarkly. If your application quits without this shutdown step, you may not see your requests and users on the dashboard, because they are derived from analytics events. **This is something you only need to do once**.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
# shut down the client, since we're about to quit
ld_client.close()
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Customizing your client

You can also pass custom parameters to the client by creating a custom configuration object:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="sdk7"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'sdk7', },
    { label: 'Python SDK versions 6.12.x and earlier', value: 'sdk6', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk7">

```py
config = Config(sdk_key='YOUR_SDK_KEY', http=HTTPConfig(connect_timeout=5))
ldclient.set_config(config)
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="sdk6">

```py
config = Config(sdk_key='YOUR_SDK_KEY', connect_timeout=5)
ldclient.set_config(config)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The `Config` type allows you to specify a variety of options. To learn more about the specific configuration options that are available in this SDK, read the [SDK's API docs](https://launchdarkly-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-main.html#module-ldclient.config).

## Users

Feature flag targeting and rollouts are all determined by the _user_ you pass to your `Variation` calls. In our Python SDK, users are simply dictionaries. Here's an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
user = {
    "key": "aa0ceb",
    "firstName": "Ernestina",
    "lastName": "Evans",
    "email": "ernestina@example.com",
    "custom": {
      "groups": ["Google", "Microsoft"]
    }
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Let's walk through this snippet. The most important attribute is the user key. In this case we've used the hash `"aa0ceb"`. **The user key is the only mandatory user attribute**. The key should also uniquely identify each user. You can use a primary key, an email address, or a hash, as long as the same user always has the same key. We recommend using a hash if possible.

All of the other attributes (like `firstName`, `email`, and the `custom` attributes) are optional. The attributes you specify will automatically appear on our dashboard, meaning that you can start segmenting and targeting users with these attributes.

Besides the `key`, LaunchDarkly supports the following attributes at the "top level". Remember, all of these are optional:

- `ip`: Must be an IP address.
- `firstName`: Must be a string. If you provide a first name, you can search for users on the Users page by name.
- `lastName`: Must be a string. If you provide a last name, you can search for users on the Users page by name.
- `country`: Must be a string representing the country associated with the user.
- `email`: Must be a string representing the user's email address. If an `avatar` URL is not provided, we'll use [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/) to try to display an avatar for the user on the Users page.
- `avatar`: Must be an absolute URL to an avatar image for the user.
- `name`: Must be a string. You can search for users on the User page by name
- `anonymous`: Must be a boolean. See the section below on anonymous users for more details.

In addition to built-in attributes, you can pass us any of your own user data by passing `custom` attributes, like the `groups` attribute in the example above.

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>A note on types</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>
    Most of our built-in attributes (like names and email addresses) expect string values. Custom attribute values can
    be strings, booleans (like True or False), numbers, or lists of strings, booleans or numbers. If you enter a custom
    value on our dashboard that looks like a number or a boolean, it'll be interpreted that way.
  </CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Custom attributes are one of the most powerful features of LaunchDarkly. They let you target users according to any data that you want to send to us, including organizations, groups, andaccount plans. Anything you pass to us becomes available instantly on our dashboard.

## Private user attributes

You can optionally configure the Python SDK to treat some or all user attributes as [Private user attribute](/home/users/attributes#creating-private-user-attributes). Private user attributes can be used for targeting purposes, but are removed from the user data sent back to LaunchDarkly.

In the Python SDK there are two ways to define private attributes for the entire LaunchDarkly client:

- In the LaunchDarkly `config`, you can set `all_attributes_private` to true. If this is enabled, all user attributes (except the key) for all users are removed before the user is sent to LaunchDarkly.
- In the LaunchDarkly `config` object, you can define a list of `private_attribute_names`. If any user has a custom or built-in attribute named in this list, it will be removed before the user is sent to LaunchDarkly.

You can also define a set of `privateAttributeNames` on the user object itself. For example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
user = {
    "key": "aa0ceb",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "privateAttributeNames": ["email"]
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

When this user is sent back to LaunchDarkly, the `email` attribute will be removed.

## Anonymous users

You can also distinguish logged-in users from anonymous users in the SDK, as follows:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
user = { "key":"aa0ceb", "anonymous": True }
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

You will still need to generate a unique key for anonymous users. Session IDs or UUIDs work best for this. Anonymous users still count toward your plan's MAU limit, so make sure you capture and reuse your anonymous user's key between requests.

Anonymous users work just like regular users, except that they won't appear on your Users page in LaunchDarkly. You also can't search for anonymous users on your Features page, and you can't search or autocomplete by anonymous user keys. This is actually a good thing, because it keeps anonymous users from polluting your Users page!

## Aliased users

There are situations in which multiple LaunchDarkly users can represent one person. For example, this can happen when a person initially logs into an application. The person might be represented by an anonymous user before they log in, and a different user after they log in. In that case, that one person would be identified by two different users as denoted by different user keys.

The SDK can associate these two LaunchDarkly users by sending an alias event. You can manually tell the SDK to send an alias event with the `alias` method.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
ldclient.get().alias(new_user, previous_user)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Variation

The `variation` method determines which variation of a feature flag a user receives.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
show_feature = ldclient.get().variation("your.feature.key", user, False)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

`variation` calls take the feature flag key, an `LDUser`, and a default value.

The default value will only be returned if an error is encountered. For example, the default value returns if the feature flag key doesn't exist or the user doesn't have a key specified.

The `variation` call will automatically create a user in LaunchDarkly if a user with that user key doesn't exist already. There's no need to create users ahead of time (but if you do need to, take a look at Identify).

## VariationDetail

The `variation_detail` method allows you to evaluate a feature flag (using the same parameters as you would for `variation`) and receive more information about how the value was calculated.

The variation detail is returned in an object that contains both the result value and a "reason" object which will tell you, for instance, if the user was individually targeted for the flag or was matched by one of the flag's rules. It will also indicate if the flag returned the default value due to an error. You can examine the "reason" data programmatically; you can also view it with Data Export, if you are capturing detailed analytics events for this flag.

To learn more, read [Evaluation reasons](/sdk/concepts/evaluation-reasons).

## Track

The `track` method allows you to record actions your users take on your site. This lets you record events that take place on your server. In LaunchDarkly, you can tie these events to goals in A/B tests. Here's a simple example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
ldclient.get().track("your-goal-key", user)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

You can also attach an extra dictionary containing arbitrary data to your event:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
ldclient.get().track("Completed purchase", user, { "price": 320 })
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Identify

The `identify` method creates or updates users on LaunchDarkly, making them available for targeting and autocomplete on the dashboard. In most cases, you won't need to call `identify`. The `variation` call will automatically create users on the dashboard for you. `identify` can be useful if you want to pre-populate your dashboard before launching any features.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
ldclient.get().identify(user)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## All Flags

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Creating users</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Unlike variation and identify calls, `all_flags_state` does not send events to LaunchDarkly. Thus, users are not created or updated in the LaunchDarkly dashboard.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

The `all_flags_state` method captures the state of all feature flag keys with regard to a specific user. This includes their values, as well as other metadata.

This method can be useful for passing feature flags to your front-end. In particular, it can be used to provide bootstrap flag settings for our [JavaScript SDK](/sdk/client-side/javascript).

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
state = ldclient.get().all_flags_state(user)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Secure mode hash

The `SecureModeHash` method computes an HMAC signature of a user signed with the client's SDK key. If you're using our [JavaScript SDK](/sdk/client-side/javascript) for client-side flags, this method generates the signature you need for secure mode.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
hash = ldclient.get().secure_mode_hash(user)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Offline mode

In some situations, you might want avoid remote calls to LaunchDarkly and fall back to default values for your feature flags. For example, if your software is both cloud-hosted and distributed to customers to run on premise, it might make sense to fall back to defaults when running on premise. You can do this by setting `offline` mode in the client's `Config`.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
# Initialization:
ldclient.set_config(Config("YOUR_SDK_KEY", offline=True))
ldclient.get().variation("any.feature.flag", user, False) # will always return the default value (false)

```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Flush

Internally, the LaunchDarkly SDK keeps an event buffer for `variation`, `track`, and `identify` calls. These are flushed periodically in a background thread. In some situations (for example, if you're testing out the SDK in a REPL), you may want to manually call `flush` to process events immediately. Otherwise Python may close before flushing the event buffer and your user changes and tracks will not be lost.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
ldclient.get().flush()
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The flush interval is configurable. If you need to change the interval, you can do so when configuring your client instance.

## Close

Close safely shuts down the client instance and releases all resources associated with the client. In most long-running applications, you should not have to call close.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
ldclient.get().close()
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Configuring uWSGI

The LaunchDarkly SDK is compatible with uWSGI. However, in uWSGI environments, the SDK requires the `enable-threads` option to be set.

## Logging

The Python SDK uses Python's built-in [logging library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html). Configure the logger `ldclient.util` as you would any standard Python logger.

Be aware of two considerations when enabling the DEBUG log level:

1. Debug-level logs can be very verbose. It is not recommended that you turn on debug logging in high-volume environments.
2. Potentially sensitive information is logged including LaunchDarkly users created by you in your usage of this SDK.

## HTTPS proxy

Python's standard HTTP library provides a built-in HTTPS proxy. If the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable is present then the SDK will proxy all network requests through the URL provided.

How to set the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable on Mac/Linux systems:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Shell', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```bash
export HTTPS_PROXY=https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

How to set the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable on Windows systems:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'CMD', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```bash
set HTTPS_PROXY=https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Or it can be set from within python:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
os.environ["https_proxy"] = "https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080"
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Using a database as a persistent store

The Python SDK supports Redis, Consul, or DynamoDB as a persistent store of feature flag configurations. To learn more, read [Using a persistent feature store](/sdk/concepts/feature-store).
