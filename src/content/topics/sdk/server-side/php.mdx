This reference guide documents all of the methods available in the PHP SDK, and explains in detail how these methods work. If you want to dig even deeper, our SDKs are open source. To learn more, read [PHP SDK repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/php-server-sdk) on GitHub. The online [API docs](https://launchdarkly.github.io/php-server-sdk/) contain the programmatic definitions of every type and method. Additionally you can clone and run a [sample application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-php) using this SDK.

## Getting started

Building on top of our [Getting Started guide](/home/getting-started), the following steps will get you started with using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your PHP application.

The first step is to install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and the LaunchDarkly SDK as a dependency in your application. Refer to the [SDK releases page](https://github.com/launchdarkly/php-server-sdk/releases) to identify the latest version if you want to depend on a specific version.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="php"
  values={[
    { label: 'Shell', value: 'php', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="php">

```bash
php composer.phar require launchdarkly/server-sdk

# Note that in earlier versions, this was "launchdarkly/launchdarkly-php"
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Then require Composer's autoloader.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="php"
  values={[
    { label: 'PHP', value: 'php', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="php">

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Once the SDK is installed, you'll want to create a single, shared instance of [`LDClient`](http://launchdarkly.github.io/php-server-sdk/classes/LaunchDarkly-LDClient.html). You should specify your SDK key here so that your application will be authorized to connect to LaunchDarkly and for your application and environment.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="php"
  values={[
    { label: 'PHP', value: 'php', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="php">

```php
$client = new LaunchDarkly\LDClient("YOUR_SDK_KEY");
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Using `$client`, you can check which variation a particular user should receive for a given feature flag.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="php"
  values={[
    { label: 'PHP', value: 'php', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="php">

```php
$user = new LaunchDarkly\LDUser("user@test.com");

if ($client->variation("your.flag.key", $user)) {
    // application code to show the feature
} else {
    // the code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

That's all!

You may remember from our [Getting Started guide](/home/getting-started) that users should be sure to shut down the LaunchDarkly client on application termination. This step does not exist in PHP because the PHP SDK does not maintain long-lived network connections nor an event queue.

## Fetching flags

There are two distinct methods of integrating LaunchDarkly in a PHP environment.

- [Guzzle Cache Middleware](https://github.com/Kevinrob/guzzle-cache-middleware) to request and cache HTTP responses in an in-memory array (default)
- [ld-relay](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay) to retrieve and store flags in Redis (recommended)

We strongly suggest using the ld-relay. Per-flag caching mode (Guzzle) is only intended for low-throughput environments.

## Using Guzzle

Require Guzzle as a dependency:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="php"
  values={[
    { label: 'PHP', value: 'php', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="php">

```php
php composer.phar require "guzzlehttp/guzzle:6.2.1"
php composer.phar require "kevinrob/guzzle-cache-middleware:1.4.1"
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

It will then be used as the default way of fetching flags.

With Guzzle, you could persist your cache somewhere other than the default in-memory store, like Memcached or Redis.

You could then specify your cache when initializing the client with the cache option.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="php"
  values={[
    { label: 'PHP', value: 'php', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="php">

```php
$client = new LaunchDarkly\LDClient("YOUR_SDK_KEY", array("cache" => $cacheStorage));
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Using LD-Relay

Setup [ld-relay](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay) in [daemon-mode](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay#redis-storage-and-daemon-mode) with Redis

Require Predis as a dependency:


<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="php"
  values={[
    { label: 'PHP', value: 'php', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="php">

```php
php composer.phar require "predis/predis:1.0.*"
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Create the LDClient with the Redis feature requester as an option:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="php"
  values={[
    { label: 'PHP', value: 'php', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="php">

```php
$client = new LaunchDarkly\LDClient("your_sdk_key", ['feature_requester_class' => 'LaunchDarkly\LDDFeatureRequester', 'redis_host' => 'your.redis.host', 'redis_port' => 6379]);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="warning">
  <CalloutTitle>Caching and PHP</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>

PHP's *shared-nothing* architecture means that the out-of-the-box in-memory HTTP cache used by our SDK won't cache
feature flags across requests. In production, we strongly recommend the ld-relay for PHP.
