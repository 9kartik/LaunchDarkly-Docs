# Your team and LaunchDarkly

<Metadata timeToRead={props.timeToRead} lastModifiedDateFormatted={props.lastModifiedDateFormatted} />

This topic explains how to join LaunchDarkly as a new team member.

<Callout intent="alert">
  <CalloutTitle>LaunchDarkly is for groups and teams</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>
    You cannot sign up for LaunchDarkly as a user who is not associated with a company's team account. Instead, an admin
    or account owner from your team must send you an invitation email.
  </CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Bringing your team to LaunchDarkly

If you want to get your team started with LaunchDarkly, you have a few different options for how to add team members to your organization.

- You can invite individual team members
- You can import team members from your identity provider (IdP)
- Team members on a LaunchDarkly trial can join from the trial

  <CalloutTitle>LaunchDarkly supports SCIM</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>
    LaunchDarkly supports the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) API specification for certain identity
    providers. SCIM is designed to make managing user identities in cloud-based applications and services easier. To use
    SCIM with LaunchDarkly, you must be using one of the IdPs we support that uses SCIM, and you must be an Enterprise
    customer.
  </CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Adding individual team members

If your team already has a LaunchDarkly account, a team member with invite privileges (typically an owner or admin) must send individual members email invitations to join the team.

After prospective members receive the invitation, they follow the sign up instructions to join your team's account.

## Adding members from an identity provider

LaunchDarkly supports multiple third-party IdPs. If your company uses an IdP to manage access with single sign-on, you must log into LaunchDarkly for the first time from the IdP.

To learn more about IdP-driven user provisioning, read Single sign-on.

## Joining from a LaunchDarkly trial

If you're on a LaunchDarkly trial, you can use the same email address to join your team.

<Callout intent="alert">
  <CalloutTitle>Invitations fail when your email address is in use by a trial account </CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>
    If your email address is associated with a trial account, you must de-associate it or delete the trial account
    before you can receive an invitation email from your team. Follow either procedure below to resolve that problem
  </CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Each email address is associated with one LaunchDarkly account, so if you used your preferred email address to sign up for a trial, you must de-associate it with the trial before you can join your team's LaunchDarkly account.

Here's how to convert your account from a trial to a team account:

1. Log in to your existing LaunchDarkly trial account.
2. Navigate to the Account settings page and click into the Profile tab.
3. Replace your email address in the "Email address" field with a different email address.
4. Click Update my info.
5. You can now accept the invitation from your team owner using the email you used for the trial account.
