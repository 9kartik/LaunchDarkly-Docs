<CalloutTitle>Approval workflows are available for LaunchDarkly's Early Access Program</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

This feature is only available to members of LaunchDarkly's Early Access Program (EAP). Curious about approval workflows? [Sign up for the EAP](http://launchdarkly.com/eap).

## Overview

This topic explains how to use approval workflows to request review for changes you plan to make to a flag. It also explains how to review a change request when you are asked to.

Approval workflows allow more people to have input on planned changes to a flag. These review-style approvals mimic common code review workflows, such as PR reviews in GitHub. They're a fast, convenient way for more members of your team to contribute to changes to your feature flags, and for you to gain confidence in the changes you're about to make.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Reviewing a change request does not make or prevent flag changes</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Approving flag changes does not make them take effect automatically. An approval is a signal of mutual agreement on a planned flag change. A team member must enable the flag changes, or wait for a scheduled change to take effect, regardless of whether or not the change is approved. Similarly, declining a flag change does not prevent the change from taking effect.

## Understanding approval workflows

When a team member plans a flag change, they have the option to request approval for that change from anyone in their LaunchDarkly project. 

Anyone with a `writer`, `owner / admin`, or custom role can approve a flag change, regardless of whether or not their review has been requested. Team members who the requester chooses receive an email notifying them that their review has been requested.

From that email, a requested approver can access a summary page of the flag changes and approve or decline the changes proposed.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>You can configure specialized approval workflows with custom roles</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You can configure a custom role policy to allow or deny specific actions on change requests. For example, you can deny any role from changing a flag in the Production environment without an approval from a team member with the `owner / admin` role.

To learn more about custom roles actions for this feature, read [Using actions](/home/account-security/custom-roles/actions).

## Requesting approval on a flag change

You can request approval on changes to a flag's targeting at any point after creation. 

![A GIF showing the interactions of requesting approval on changes.](../../images/approvals-requesting-approval.gif)

You cannot review your own requests, but you can delete them from the "Change request" screen that is created after you request others' approval.

To learn more, read [Deleting a change request](#deleting-a-change-request).

![The "Change request" screen.](../../images/approvals-approval-screen.png)

The only people you can request approval from are other members of your LaunchDarkly project. You can request approval from anyone in your project, with a maximum of 10 people.

Here's how:

1. Make the changes you wish to make to any flag. 
2. Click the **dropdown icon** in the **Save Changes** button. The additional actions menu opens.

3. Enter a **Description** to add context that helps your reviewers understand the changes you made.

4. Click **Request approval**. The approval request screen appears.
5. (Optional) If necessary, you can edit your flag changes by clicking the **Edit** button.
6. Choose one or more reviewers from the **Select reviewers to be notified** dropdown.
7. Leave a **Comment** about your request.
8. Click **Request approval**.

The people you chose from the dropdown each receive an email asking them to approve your flag changes. The flag's **Targeting** page also updates with an icon to indicate that there are pending changes waiting for review.

## Reviewing flag change requests

If someone requests your approval on a flag change, you will receive an email. From that email, you can click through to the "Change request" screen and review the request.

To approve or decline a change:

1. Find the email from "The Team at LaunchDarkly" in your email client. The email subject includes name of the project, environment, and flag you're being asked to review and the phrase "Review request."

![The email notification from LaunchDarkly.](../../images/approvals-email.png)

2. In the email body, click **Review request**. A new tab with LaunchDarkly's "Change request" screen appears.

![The "Change request" screen.](../../images/approvals-approval-screen.png)

3. Review the flag changes and choose the "Approve changes" or "Decline changes" radio button.
4. Click **Submit**. The "Review history" section updates to indicate that you reviewd the change request.
5. (Optional) You can apply the proposed changes immediately after approving the change by clicking **Apply Changes**.
  
  a. If you choose to apply the flag changes, you will be asked to confirm your choice. Verify that you want to make the changes and click **Save Changes**.

  b. If you approve a change request but choose not to apply it, the original requester, or any team member with a writer, owner / admin, or custom role can apply the  changes you approved.

In addition to using the link in the email to access the "Change request" screen, you can see pending flag changes and approval requests on the "Pending changes" screen. 

To access this screen, click the icon on the flag's **Targeting** page.

## Deleting a change request

You may delete a request for changes to a flag while it's pending review. You can do this in two ways: from the 
"Pending changes" screen or from the change request page.

### Deleting a change request from the "Pending changes" screen

To delete change requests from a flag's "Pending changes" screen:

1. Navigate to the flag's **Targeting** page and click the **Pending Changes** icon. The "Pending Changes" screen appears. 
2. Find the change you wish to delete and click the three-dot **overflow menu**. Additional options appear.
3. Choose **Delete**. A confirmation screen appears.
4. Type the flag's name or key to confirm. 
5. Click **Delete**. The request is deleted.
