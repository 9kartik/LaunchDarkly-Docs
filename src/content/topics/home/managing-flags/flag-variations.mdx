# Toggling flags on and off

## Overview

This topic explains how to use a flag's **Variations** tab to create and edit your feature flag's variations and outlines the different types of flag variations.

## Understanding flag types

LaunchDarkly supports different flag types.

- **Boolean flags** have two settings: `true` or `false`.
- **Multivariate flags** have multiple settings that let you define different variations. Those settings include strings, numbers, JSON objects, or JSON arrays.

To learn more about creating different types of flags, read [Creating a feature flag](./creating-a-feature-flag).

## Managing flag variations

In the Variations tab, you can add, edit, or delete variations of existing flags.

Boolean flags never need variations, because they can only be set to `true` or `false`. Multivariate flags, however, can be configured in many ways to create custom experiences or reactions.

Here are the flag modifications you can do in the flag's Variations tab:

- **Boolean flags**: you can edit each variation’s name and description.
- **Multivariate flags**: you can edit any variation’s value, name, and description. You can also add and delete variations for a multivariate flag.

When you add, edit, or delete a feature flag's variations, the change impacts environments within the project.

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>Changing variation types</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>
    After a feature flag has been created, you cannot change the type of its variations. For example, you can't edit a
    feature flag that returns numbers to make it return strings instead.
  </CalloutDescription>

<Callout intent="alert">
  <CalloutTitle>Deleting variations</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>
    When you delete a variation, custom rules that return that variation are also deleted. If a custom rule has a
    percentage rollout, the rollout for that variation is set to zero. If the default rule returns the deleted
    variation, it will be changed to return the `off` variation instead.
