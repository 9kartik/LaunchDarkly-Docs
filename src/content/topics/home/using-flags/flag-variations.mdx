## Overview 

This topic explains how to use a flag's **Variations** tab to create and edit your feature flag's variations and outlines the different types of flag variations.

## Understanding flag types 

LaunchDarkly supports different flag types. 

- **Boolean flags** have two settings: `true` or `false`.
- **Multivariate flags** have multiple settings that let you define different variations. Those settings include strings, numbers, JSON objects, or JSON arrays.

To learn more about creating different types of flags, read [Creating a feature flag](/home/getting-started/feature-flags). 

## Managing flag variations 

In the Variations tab, you can add, edit, or delete variations of existing flags.

Boolean flags never need variations, because they can only be set to `true` or `false`. Multivariate flags, however, can be configured in many ways to create custom experiences or reactions.

Here are the flag modifications you can do in the flag's Variations tab: 

- **Boolean flags**: you can edit each variation’s name and description.
- **Multivariate flags**: you can edit any variation’s value, name, and description. You can also add and delete variations for a multivariate flag.

When you add, edit, or delete a feature flag's variations, the change impacts environments within the project. 

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>Changing variation types</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>
    After a feature flag has been created, you cannot change the type of its variations. For example, you can't edit a
    feature flag that returns numbers to make it return strings instead.

  <CalloutTitle>Deleting variations</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

When you delete a variation, custom rules that return that variation are also deleted. If a custom rule has a percentage rollout, the rollout for that variation is set to zero. If the default rule returns the deleted variation, it will be changed to return the `off` variation instead.

## Changing default flag variations

When you create a feature flag, some of its variations are designated as *default* variations. A flag's default variations are the variations that are served when a flag is on or off unless you specify otherwise. 

For example, a boolean flag could have `false` set as its default **off** variation and `true` set as its default **on** variation. A multivariate flag could have `variation 1` set as its default **off** variation and `variation 2` set as its default **on** variation, with `variation 3` and `variation 4` configured to appear in other, more specific circumstances, such as when a user is based in a specific region or has a certain email address.

Default variations are designated automatically every time you create a feature flag. You can accept the default variations or change them. When you do this and click **Save Flag**, the flag is created across all environments in your project with these variations set as its `on` and `off` values.

You can change a flag's default variations from the **Variations** tab. Update the default variations in the "Defaults for new environments" section. Subsequent environments you create also use the flag's default values. If you change the default variations and then create a new environment, however, the environment you create will use the updated default variations.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Editing default variations only impacts new environments</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>If you modify a flag's default variations, the updated default variations only apply to new environments. You can not change the default variations in environments that already exist.</CalloutDescription>
