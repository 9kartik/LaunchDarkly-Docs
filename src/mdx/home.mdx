# Getting started with LaunchDarkly

<Frontmatter />

Welcome to LaunchDarkly! We're excited to partner with you as you use feature flags to make high-impact changes with minimal risk and maximum control. It only takes a few minutes to get started with LaunchDarkly and control your first feature flag.

## Integrating with LaunchDarkly

The steps to integrate your application with LaunchDarkly are common across all SDKs. We provide a variety of client, server, and mobile SDKs for you to use. To learn more about our SDK offerings, read Choosing an SDK.

To setup LaunchDarkly:

1. Install the LaunchDarkly SDK in your application using your project's dependency manager. This lets your application access the LaunchDarkly SDK.
2. Import the LaunchDarkly client in your application code. This client is the primary way your application uses the SDK and communicates with LaunchDarkly.
3. Configure the LaunchDarkly client with the appropriate key for your environment and create the client. Your SDK key, Client-side ID, and Mobile key uniquely identify your project and environment, and they authorize your application to connect to LaunchDarkly.

### Flag evaluations are always available.

If the SDK you're using loses the connection with LaunchDarkly, your feature flags will still work. The SDK relies on its stored state to evaluate flags.
