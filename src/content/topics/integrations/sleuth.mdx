## Overview

This topic explains how to use the LaunchDarkly Sleuth integration.

Sleuth's native LaunchDarkly integration helps track feature flags as a source of change in your DevOps stack. Sleuth captures the full state of your LaunchDarkly feature flags at deployment time. This helps you keep track of the affected code deploys, what environment the change occurred in, who changed the flag, and flag descriptions and flag value states, both before and after code deploys.

## Prerequisites

To connect Sleuth to LaunchDarkly, you will need your LaunchDarkly credentials and have a LaunchDarkly non-Reader role to grant authorization. The integration is initiated from your Sleuth account; once connected, no further action is necessary. There are no Sleuth settings or preferences that need to be configured in LaunchDarkly.

       If you are notified that the integration is successful yet experience issues accessing deploy data in Sleuth, check with your LaunchDarkly Admin to ensure your role allows authorization of external apps (e.g., Reader or custom role).

## Setting up the Sleuth integration

To make the Sleuth integration with LaunchDarkly:

1. Log into your [Sleuth](https://app.sleuth.io/accounts/login/) Dashboard.

2. In the left sidebar, click the **Create** dropdown, then click **Add feature flags**.

3. Click on the **Enable LaunchDarkly feature flags**. 

4. Click **Authorize** to allow Sleuth to read and modify your LaunchDarkly data. 

<Callout intent="warning">
  <CalloutTitle>Authorizing Sleuth to access your data</CalloutTitle>
     <CalloutDescription>
       Clicking **Deny** prevents the integration from being instantiated. This effectively severs the ability of Sleuth analyzing feature flags as a change source.

5. The integration is successful when the green **LaunchDarkly feature flags enabled** button is displayed in the Sleuth integration card for Feature Flags.

## Configuring the Sleuth integration

Now that the Sleuth LaunchDarkly integration has been set up, you must now configure Sleuth to know which feature flags it should track. 

To select a LaunchDarkly project and environment to track:  

1. Click the **LaunchDarkly feature flags enabled** button (shown above). 

2. Select the **Feature Flag Project** and **Environment** you would like to track. The projects and environments shown in the dropdowns are taken from your LaunchDarkly configuration.

3. Give the integration a **Name**, then press **Create**. 

4. Once the connection is established, you will be taken to the Sleuth trend graph, where you will be able to monitor how your feature flags impact your code over time. You're set&mdash;now sit back and let Sleuth track your code over time.

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>Tracking multiple projects/environments</CalloutTitle>
    <CalloutDescription>
       To track multiple LaunchDarkly projects/environments in Sleuth, create a new Sleuth project. You can create as many Sleuth projects as needed to track any number of feature flag project and environment combinations. 
       
       For more information, read <a href="https://help.sleuth.io/projects#creating-a-project">Creating a project</a> in Sleuth Documentation.  
  </CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Disabling the Sleuth integration

To disable the Sleuth integration:

1. Click the gear icon in the upper-right corner of the dashboard. 
2. Click **Delete**. Click **Delete** again if you're sure.

3. The integration is removed.

## LaunchDarkly Slack notifications from Sleuth

With Slack integration in Sleuth, notify your entire team or just the commit author/PR initiator of a code change, including feature flag changes. 

For more information, read about the <a href="https://help.sleuth.io/integrations/slack">Slack integration</a> in Sleuth Documentation. The Sleuth Slack integration works independently&mdash;yet alongside&mdash;the [LaunchDarkly Slack integration](/integrations/slack/).
