This topic explains how to use LaunchDarkly's trigger feature with New Relic One. For example, you can create an policy in New Relic that uses a LaunchDarkly trigger to toggle a flag on or off if a performance metric drops below a certain threshold.

## Prerequisites

In order to complete this topic, you must meet the following prerequisites:

* You must have a feature flag with a trigger. To learn more about creating triggers, read [Creating a new flag trigger](/integrations/triggers#creating-a-new-flag-trigger).
* You must have access to the trigger's URL, which you copied and saved during the trigger creation process. To learn more, read [Understanding flag triggers' security](/integrations/triggers#understanding-flag-triggers-security).
* You must have an existing [New Relic One](https://one.newrelic.com/) account. 

## Connecting a flag trigger to New Relic One

Connecting a LaunchDarkly trigger to New Relic takes two steps.

You must:

1. Create a webhook-type notification channel in New Relic with your trigger URL, and
2. Connect that webhook to a New Relic policy.

### Setting up a JSON template in New Relic One

First you must configure a JSON template to use the LaunchDarkly trigger. 

To configure the template:

1. Log in to New Relic.
2. Navigate to **Alerts & AI** and look for the **Notification Channels** section in the sidebar.
3. In the **Notification Channels** section, click **+ New Notification Channel**.
4. Select **Webhook** as the channel type.
5. Paste the LaunchDarkly trigger URL into the **Base URL** field.
6. Click **Create Channel**. 

### Connecting the webhook to a New Relic policy

After you create the webhook notification channel in New Relic, you must connect it to a policy in order for the LaunchDarkly trigger to perform actions on the flag. 

1. Under **Alerts & AI**, navigate to **Policies**.
2. Select the policy you wish to connect to the trigger.
3. On the policy's **Notification channels** tab, add your newly-created webhook channel.

That's it! When the conditions of your policy are met, your flag changes will now be performed.
