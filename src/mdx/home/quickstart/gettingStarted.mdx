Here is a code snippet:

```javascript snippetId=targeting-custom
export function createAccessDecision(props = {}) {
  // Cool code
  return new AccessDecision(fromJS(props))
}

export function combineAccessDecisions(...args) {
  const decisions = List(args)
  const isAllowed = decisions.every(d => d.isAllowed)
  const firstDenied = decisions.find(d => !d.isAllowed)
  return new AccessDecision({
    isAllowed,
    reason: firstDenied ? firstDenied.reason : decisions.first().reason,
    appliedRoleName: firstDenied ? firstDenied.appliedRoleName : decisions.first().appliedRoleName,
  })
}
```

```go snippetId=targeting-custom
var InternalPostResetAccountToken = Route{
	"internal.post.reset.account.token",
	"POST",
}

var InternalDeleteAccountToken = Route{
	"internal.delete.account.token",
	"DELETE",
}
```

```ruby snippetId=targeting-custom
user = {:key => "foo@example.com", :custom => {:groups => "beta_testers"}}
```

And here is another code snippet:

```go snippetId=example
if member.Role != primaryRole {
  m.Role = primaryRole
  accesses = append(accesses, roles.ResourceAccess{
    Action:   roles.UpdateMemberRole,
    Resource: resource_identifiers.MakeMemberResourceIdentifier(&member.Id, nil),
  })
}

allCustomRolesById := map[bson.ObjectId]roles.CustomRole{}
for _, role := range allCustomRoles {
  allCustomRolesById[role.Id] = role
}
```

```javascript snippetId=example
export function createAccessDecision(props = {}) {
  if (props.props instanceof AccessDecision) {
    return props
  }
  return new AccessDecision(fromJS(props))
}
```

```ruby snippetId=example
puts "Hello world!"
```

Welcome to LaunchDarkly! We're excited to partner with you as you use feature flags to make high-impact
changes with minimal risk and maximum control.

<Callout intent="warning">
  <Callout.Title>Be careful</Callout.Title>
  <Callout.Description>This is something you should be careful about.</Callout.Description>
</Callout>

It only takes a few minutes to get started with LaunchDarkly and control your first feature flag.

## Integrating with LaunchDarkly

The steps to integrate your application with LaunchDarkly are common across all SDKs. We provide a variety
of client, server, and mobile SDKs for you to use. To learn more about our SDK offerings, read Choosing an
SDK.

To setup LaunchDarkly:

1. Install the LaunchDarkly SDK in your application using your project's dependency manager. This lets your
   application access the LaunchDarkly SDK.
2. Import the LaunchDarkly client in your application code. This client is the primary way your application
   uses the SDK and communicates with LaunchDarkly.
3. Configure the LaunchDarkly client with the appropriate key for your environment and create the client.
   Your SDK key, Client-side ID, and Mobile key uniquely identify your project and environment, and they
   authorize your application to connect to LaunchDarkly.

### Flag evaluations are always available.

If the SDK you're using loses the connection with LaunchDarkly, your feature flags will still work. The SDK
relies on its stored state to evaluate flags.
