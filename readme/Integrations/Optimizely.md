The Optimizely integration allows you to import A/B testing goals into LaunchDarkly. This lets you re-use your click, pageview, and custom goal definitions in your LaunchDarkly A/B tests.

To set up the integration, click on the [Integrations](https://app.launchdarkly.com/integrations) page and enter your Optimizely token in the text field. 

Next, navigate to the [Goals](https://app.launchdarkly.com/goals) page and click the 'Import Optimizely goals' button to import your Optimizely goals.

Once your goals are imported, you can use them to [Running A/B tests](doc:running-ab-tests) and measure how variations of a feature flag impact those goals.
