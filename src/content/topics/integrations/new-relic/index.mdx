## Overview

This topic explains how to use the LaunchDarkly New Relic One integration to view LaunchDarkly events in New Relic. [New Relic One](https://www.newrelic.com/) is an [application performance management (APM)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_performance_management) tool that allows customers to monitor the operational health of their application and infrastructure.

LaunchDarkly integrates with New Relic One. LaunchDarkly sends feature flag change events to New Relic as deployment events. These events appear as new deployments in the [One console's APM Event log](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/events/deployments-page-view-impact-your-app-users#dep_procedures).

## Prerequisites

To configure the integration, you must [create a REST API key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#rest-api-key) on your New Relic One account.

## Configuring LaunchDarkly to send flag change events to New Relic One

To configure LaunchDarkly to send events to New Relic:

1. Navigate to the Integrations page and find the "New Relic" card.

2. Click **+ Integration**. The integration configuration sidebar appears.

3. Give the integration a human-readable **Name**.

4. Paste in your [**New Relic REST API key**](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#rest-api-key).

5. Paste in your [**New Relic application ID**](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/app-id-other-product-ids#ui).

6. Click **Save New Relic Configuration**.

### Adding custom policies to the New Relic integration

By default, the New Relic integration sends production flag change events to
New Relic. You can customize those events with the policy editor using the same language and construction as if you were creating a custom role.

To learn more, read [Custom Roles](/home/account-security/custom-roles).

You can customize the events LaunchDarkly sends to New Relic by using the policy
editor in the New Relic configuration panel:

## Accessing LaunchDarkly events in New Relic One

To view LaunchDarkly events in New Relic One, navigate to your application's APM dashboard, then select the **Event log** tab on your sidebar and filter for "Deployments" link on the sidebar.

Any flag change events in your production environment (default policy) will create a new deployment event. You will be able to see the impact of that flag change within this deployment page.
