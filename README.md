## ðŸš´ Development

```shell
yarn && yarn start
```

Then navigate to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## ðŸŒ— Staging

The staging url is [docs-stg.launchdarkly.com](https://docs-stg.launchdarkly.com).

Staging is automatically refreshed on push to master. See [Build & Deploy](#-build--deploy).

## ðŸš€ Build & Deploy
Github action automatically builds and deploys to staging on push to master.

If you want to manually deploy your own branch to staging, do this:

```shell
yarn deploy
```

This will build gatsby and upload the artifacts to the staging s3 bucket.

## ðŸ‘¥ Public content

The `src/content` folder is meant to be publicly mirrored. This is so anyone can submit a PR
to update our docs.

## ðŸ”¥ Issues
If you encounter what looks like a gatsby cache issue, you can clean the gatsby cache first:

```shell script
yarn clean
```

If you still encounter issues, perform a clean-all to delete all possible caches:

```shell script
yarn clean-all
```
