3. Choose the LaunchDarkly app from the list of apps.
4. Navigate to the **SSO** section of your LaunchDarkly OneLogin application.
5. Copy **OneLogin's SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP)** value to a secure place.
6. Open LaunchDarkly in a separate tab. You need information from OneLogin to finish configuration.

   }
   ]
   }
   [/block]
7. (Optional) Configure the **lastName** and **firstName** fields with user information.

   ],
   "sizing": "80",
   "caption": "The Edit Login screen."
   }
   ]
   }
   [/block]
8. Enter role information for the user. The three supported roles are:

- `reader`
- `writer`
- `admin`

8. (Optional) If you are using a custom role, enter the custom role key in the **customRole** field. If a user has multiple custom roles, add them by entering the role keys for each role, separated by commas.
   <Callout intent="alert">
     <CalloutTitle>Enter All of a User's Roles</CalloutTitle>
     <CalloutDescription>
       When you are configuring a user, you must enter the complete list of the user's roles, including the roles
       already present in LaunchDarkly. This list overrides what is in LaunchDarkly. It does not append to an existing
       list in LaunchDarkly. If you make any changes to the user's name or roles within OneLogin, they update the next
       time the user accesses LaunchDarkly through the OneLogin portal.
     </CalloutDescription>
   </Callout>
9. Click **Save**.

Now this user can access the LaunchDarkly app through OneLogin.

If this is a new user who has never accessed LaunchDarkly before, an account will be automatically created for them when they log in through the OneLogin portal.

## User Provisioning with SCIM

You can also configure OneLogin to provision users with LaunchDarkly's SCIM API.

<Callout intent="alert">

    already enabled SSO by following the procedure above.
