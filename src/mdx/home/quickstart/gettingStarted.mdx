## Integrating with LaunchDarkly

The steps to integrate your application with LaunchDarkly are common across all SDKs. We provide a variety
of client, server, and mobile SDKs for you to use. To learn more about our SDK offerings, read Choosing an
SDK.

To setup LaunchDarkly:

1. Install the LaunchDarkly SDK in your application using your project's dependency manager. This lets your
   application access the LaunchDarkly SDK.
2. Import the LaunchDarkly client in your application code. This client is the primary way your application
   uses the SDK and communicates with LaunchDarkly.
3. Configure the LaunchDarkly client with the appropriate key for your environment and create the client.
   Your SDK key, Client-side ID, and Mobile key uniquely identify your project and environment, and they
   authorize your application to connect to LaunchDarkly.

### Flag evaluations are always available.

If the SDK you're using loses the connection with LaunchDarkly, your feature flags will still work. The SDK
relies on its stored state to evaluate flags.
