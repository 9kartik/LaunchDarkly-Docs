<Callout intent="alert">
  <CalloutTitle>Swift and Objective-C compatibility</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

This documentation is for the latest version of the LaunchDarkly SDK for iOS.

SDK versions 4.0.0 and later are written in Swift. These versions are compatible with applications written in either Swift or Objective-C. See inline code samples throughout the documentation for use with either language.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

This reference guide documents all of the methods available in the iOS SDK, and explains in detail how these methods work. If you want to dig even deeper, our SDKs are open source. To learn more, view the source on the [iOS SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ios-client-sdk/tree/v5) or the generated [API docs](https://launchdarkly.github.io/ios-client-sdk/). Additionally you can clone and run sample applications using this SDK with [iOS](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-ios-swift), [macOS](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-macos), and [tvOS](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-tvos).

## Getting started

Building on top of our [Getting Started guide](/home/getting-started), the following steps will get you started with using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your application.

### Including the SDK as a dependency

The first step is to install the LaunchDarkly SDK as a dependency in your application. LaunchDarkly supports multiple methods for installing the SDK in your application.

#### Swift Package Manager
---
<br/>

If you use the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), you can install the SDK through Xcode or include it as a dependency in your `Package.swift` file.

To add a package dependency to your Xcode project, select `File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency` and enter the [iOS SDK repository URL](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ios-client-sdk) clone URL, then select your desired version constraints.

Including the SDK as a dependency in a `Package.swift` file would look like this:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Package.swift', value: 'swift', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="swift">

```swift
//...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/launchdarkly/ios-client-sdk.git", .upToNextMinor("5.4.0")),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "YOUR_TARGET",
            dependencies: ["LaunchDarkly"]
        )
    ],
//...
```
</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

#### CocoaPods
---
<br/>

If you use [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/), you can install the SDK by adding the following to your `Podfile`. Refer to the [SDK releases page](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ios-client-sdk/releases) to identify the latest version.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="ruby"
  values={[
    { label: 'Podfile', value: 'ruby', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="ruby">

```ruby
use_frameworks!
target 'YourTargetName' do
  pod 'LaunchDarkly', '~> 5.4'
end
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

#### Carthage
---
<br/>

If you use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), you can install the SDK by specifying it in your `Cartfile`. Again, refer to the [SDK releases page](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ios-client-sdk/releases) to identify the latest version.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Cartfile', value: 'swift', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="swift">

```swift
github "launchdarkly/ios-client" ~> 5.4
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

#### Installing the SDK manually
---
<br/>

Refer to the [SDK readme](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ios-client-sdk/blob/master/README.md) for instructions on installing the SDK without CocoaPods or Carthage.

### Using the SDK in your application

This is a brief overview of using the SDK, see the detailed sections below for more information on configuration and advanced features.

#### Importing
---
<br/>

First import the LaunchDarkly client in your application code.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Swift', value: 'swift', },
    { label: 'Objective-C', value: 'objc', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="swift">

```swift
import LaunchDarkly
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="objc">

```objectivec
@import LaunchDarkly;
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

#### Initializing the SDK
---
<br/>

Now that the SDK is imported, it can be configured and initialized. You should specify your *mobile key* when configuring the SDK so that your application will be authorized to connect to LaunchDarkly, retrieve flags for your environment, and report events.

<Callout intent="alert">
  <CalloutTitle>Mobile Keys</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Be sure to use a mobile key from your [Environments](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/environments) page. Never embed a server-side SDK key into a mobile application.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Swift', value: 'swift', },
    { label: 'Objective-C', value: 'objc', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="swift">

```swift
let config = LDConfig(mobileKey: "YOUR_MOBILE_KEY")
let user = LDUser(key: "test-user")

LDClient.start(config: config, user: user)

// If you need to ensure that the most recent flags have been received
// start supports an optional completion that is triggered when the SDK
// has retrieved flags for the configured user.
LDClient.start(config: config, user: user) {
    // Client has received flags for the user
}

// If you would like the completion to be called even in cases where
// the SDK is unable to retrieve flags for the user, there is a variant
// to the start method that takes a maximum time to wait for flag values.
// This variant notifies the completion whether the operation timed out.
LDClient.start(config: config, user: user, startWaitSeconds: 5) { timedOut in
    if timedOut {
        // The SDK may not have the most recent flags for the configured user
    } else {
        // The SDK has received flags for the configured user
    }
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="objc">

```objectivec
LDConfig *config = [[LDConfig alloc] initWithMobileKey:@"YOUR_MOBILE_KEY"];
LDUser *user = [[LDUser alloc] initWithKey:@"test-user"];

[LDClient startWithConfiguration:config user:user]
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

#### Retrieving the client instance
---
<br/>

After calling `start`, the `LDClient` instance can be retrieved with the static method `LDClient.get()`.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Swift', value: 'swift', },
    { label: 'Objective-C', value: 'objc', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="swift">

```swift
let ldClient = LDClient.get()!
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="objc">

```objectivec
LDClient *ldClient = [LDClient get];
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

#### Getting the variation to serve the configured user
---
<br/>

Using the `LDClient` instance, you can check which variation the configured user should receive for a given feature flag.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Swift', value: 'swift', },
    { label: 'Objective-C', value: 'objc', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="swift">

```swift
let showFeature = ldClient.variation(forKey: "flag-key", defaultValue: false)

if showFeature {
  // application code to show the feature
else {
  // the code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="objc">

```objectivec
BOOL showFeature = [ldClient boolVariationForKey:@"flag-key" defaultValue:NO];
if (showFeature) {
    // application code to show the feature
} else {
    // the code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

#### Terminating the client instance
---
<br/>

Lastly, when your application is about to terminate, shut down the `LDClient` instance. This ensures that the client releases any resources it is using, and that any pending analytics events are delivered to LaunchDarkly. If your application quits without this shutdown step, you may not see your requests and users on the dashboard, because they are derived from analytics events. **This is something you only need to do one time**.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Swift', value: 'swift', },
    { label: 'Objective-C', value: 'objc', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="swift">

```swift
ldClient.close()
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="objc">

```objectivec
[ldClient close];
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Background fetch

When the app is backgrounded, the SDK does not receive real-time events. However, MacOS supports background fetch which updates flag values opportunistically, according to iOS standard defaults. iOS does not support background fetch.

To change the  background fetch interval for flags in your app, add the following code in your `LDConfig`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Swift', value: 'swift', },
    { label: 'Objective-C', value: 'objc', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="swift">

```swift
var ldConfig = LDConfig(mobileKey: "MY_MOBILE_KEY")
ldConfig.backgroundFlagPollingInterval = 3600
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="objc">

```objectivec
LDConfig *config = [[LDConfig alloc] initWithMobileKey:@"YOUR_MOBILE_KEY"];
config.backgroundFlagPollingInterval = 3600
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Multiple environments

LaunchDarkly's iOS SDK supports having multiple `LDClient` instances tied to separate mobile keys. This allows evaluating flags from multiple environments.

All `LDClient` instances evaluate against the same `LDUser`. The mobile keys for additional environments are specified, along with identifying names, in a map passed to your `LDConfig` object.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Swift', value: 'swift', },
    { label: 'Objective-C', value: 'objc', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="swift">

```swift
let user = LDUser(key: "YOUR_USER_KEY")
var config = LDConfig(mobileKey: "PRIMARY_MOBILE_KEY")
// Note that the SDK will throw error strings if you add duplicate keys or put the primary key or name in secondaryMobileKeys.
try! config.setSecondaryMobileKeys(["platform": "PLATFORM_MOBILE_KEY", "core": "CORE_MOBILE_KEY"])
LDClient.start(config: config, user: user)
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="objc">

```objectivec
LDUser *user = [[LDUser alloc] initWithKey:@"YOUR_USER_KEY"];
LDConfig *config = [[LDConfig alloc] initWithMobileKey:@"MOBILE_KEY"];
NSDictionary *otherMobileKeys = @{@"platform": @"PLATFORM_MOBILE_KEY", @"core": @"CORE_MOBILE_KEY"};
NSError *err = nil;
[config setSecondaryMobileKeys:otherMobileKeys error:&err]
[LDClient startWithConfiguration:config user:user];

```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

To access the secondary mobile key instances, use the `LDClient.get` static method, passing the indentifier assigned to your environment key in the `secondaryMobileKeys` map.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Swift', value: 'swift', },
    { label: 'Objective-C', value: 'objc', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="swift">

```swift
var coreInstance = LDClient.get(environment: "core")
let coreFlagValue = coreInstance?.variation(forKey: "CORE_FLAG_KEY", defaultValue: false)
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="objc">

```objectivec
LDClient *coreInstance = [LDClient getEnvironment:@"core"];
let coreFlagValue = [coreInstance boolVariationForKey:@"CORE_FLAG_KEY" defaultValue:NO];
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

As all the client instances use the same `LDUser` object, some SDK functionality affects all instances.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Swift', value: 'swift', },
    { label: 'Objective-C', value: 'objc', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="swift">

```swift
coreInstance.identify(/*User Object*/)
coreInstance.flush()
coreInstance.setOnline(true)
coreInstance.close()
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="objc">

```objectivec
[coreInstance identifyWithUser:/*User Object*/];
[coreInstance flush];
[coreInstance setOnline:true];
[coreInstance close];
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Track calls, listeners, and flag evaluation are all tied to the client instance they are evaluated against.
