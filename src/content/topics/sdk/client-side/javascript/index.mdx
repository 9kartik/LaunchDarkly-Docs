This reference guide documents all of the methods available in the client-side JavaScript SDK, and explains in detail how these methods work. If you want to dig even deeper, our SDKs are open source. To learn more, read [JavaScript SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/js-client-sdk). The online [API docs](https://launchdarkly.github.io/js-client-sdk/) contain the programmatic definitions of every type and method. Additionally you can clone and run a [sample application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-js) using this SDK.

<Callout intent="alert">
  <CalloutTitle>For client-side JavaScript only</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>


Our JavaScript SDK is intended for client-side (browser) feature flags **only**. If you have a Node.js application
and are looking to set up LaunchDarkly on the server-side, head to our [Node.js SDK reference](/sdk/client-side/node-js).


</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

This SDK does two things:
- Makes feature flags available to your client-side (front-end) JavaScript code.
- Sends click, pageview, and custom events from your front-end for A/B tests and analytics.

## Browser support

The LaunchDarkly client-side JavaScript SDK can be used in all major browsers. However, not all browsers have built-in support for the standard APIs that it uses. Those APIs are Promise, EventSource, and querySelectorAll; Promise is always required, the other two are optional depending on which SDK features you use.

The standard solution for ensuring that you will get the same functionality even in browsers that do not have native support for these features is to use [polyfills](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill). For a detailed description, and links to information about which browsers may require this, read [JS SDK requirements and polyfills](/sdk/client-side/javascript/requirements-polyfills).

## Getting started

Building on top of our [Getting Started guide](/home/getting-started), the following steps will get you started with using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your JavaScript code.

The first step is to make the LaunchDarkly SDK available as a dependency. There are two ways to make our JavaScript SDK available: as a module with a package manager, or with a `script` tag.

### Package manager

In most cases, making the LaunchDarkly SDK available to your application or site should be as simple as running one of the following in your project:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: 'npm', value: 'npm', },
    { label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn', },
    { label: 'bower', value: 'bower', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install --save launchdarkly-js-client-sdk
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add launchdarkly-js-client-sdk
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="bower">

```bash
# LaunchDarkly's JS SDK script is copied from unpkg in this example
bower install https://unpkg.com/launchdarkly-js-client-sdk@2
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

If you are using a package manager, and then combining dependencies with your code using a tool such as Webpack, there are various ways to import the LaunchDarkly SDK into your code. Here are two examples in commonly used frameworks:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
// using require()
const LDClient = require('launchdarkly-js-client-sdk');

// using ES2015 imports
import * as LDClient from "launchdarkly-js-client-sdk";
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

In earlier versions of the SDK, the package was named `ldclient-js` instead of `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk`.

### Script tag

To load our JavaScript SDK as a script tag, include one of the following in the `<head>` tag of your site on any pages where you need feature flags or want to track A/B testing goals.

Note that script tags with sources from unpkg and jsdelivr are not intended to be used on production environments as these introduce a critical dependency on a third-party service. The unpkg and jsdelivr scripts are intended to be used only for ease of development and getting started. In production environments, it is highly recommended that the LaunchDarkly SDK is self-hosted alongside your other JavaScript resources.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="unpkg"
  values={[
    { label: 'Loading from unpkg', value: 'unpkg', },
    { label: 'Loading from jsdelivr', value: 'jsdelivr', },
    { label: 'Loading from a self-hosted script', value: 'self', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="unpkg">

```bash
<!-- The script tag shown here automatically updates to the
     newest release that has a major version of 2. A minor
     version can be specified by including it in the url.
     See https://unpkg.com for additional examples and information.

     This method is not recommended for production use. -->
<script crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://unpkg.com/launchdarkly-js-client-sdk@2"></script>

```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="jsdelivr">

```bash
<!-- The script tag shown here automatically updates to the
     newest release that has a major version of 2. A minor
     version can be specified by including it in the url.
     See https://jsdelivr.com for additional examples and information.

     This method is not recommended for production use. -->
<script crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/launchdarkly-js-client-sdk@2"></script>

```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="self">

```bash
<!-- The script tag shown here references a self-hosted script
     which is deployed alongside other JavaScript resources in your
     application. This method is recommended for production use. -->
<script src="path/to/ldclient.min.js"></script>

```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Initializing the client

Once the dependency is installed, initialize the LaunchDarkly client. To create a client instance, you need your environment's client-side ID, available on your [account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects). Client-side IDs are not secret and you can expose them in your client-side code without risk.

In practice, you should templatize your client-side ID so that you can use the same initialization code when you switch between development, QA, and production environments.

Feature flag targeting and rollouts are determined by the _user_ viewing the page. You must pass a user context to the SDK during initialization before requesting any feature flags with `variation`. Failure to pass a valid user context to the SDK during initialization will result in a 400 error.

Here's a basic example showing how to initialize the client:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
var user = {
  "key": "aa0ceb"
};
var ldclient = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>


<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Initialization delay</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Out of the box, initializing the client will make a remote request to LaunchDarkly, so it may take 100 milliseconds or more before the ready event is emitted. If you require feature flag values before rendering the page,we recommend bootstrapping the client. To learn more, read [Bootstrapping](/sdk/features/bootstrapping#javascript). If the client is bootstrapped, it will emit the ready event immediately.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

The client will emit a `ready` event when it has been initialized. Once it has been initialized, you can safely call `variation` to access your feature flags:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
ldclient.on('ready', function() {
  console.log("It's now safe to request feature flags");
  var showFeature = ldclient.variation("YOUR_FEATURE_KEY", false);

  if (showFeature) {
   	...
  } else {
    ...
  }
});
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>Streaming Updates</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>


The SDK does not subscribe to streaming real-time updates automatically when it is initialized. As a side effect,
subscribing to the SDK's **change** event by calling **.on('change').** will cause the SDK to open a streaming
connection to LaunchDarkly. This is the only way to receive realtime updates.


</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

<Callout intent="alert">
  <CalloutTitle>Making feature flags available to the client-side SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Feature flags must be marked available to the client-side SDK before they can be used in `variation` calls on the front-end. Configure this option on your feature flag's Settings page.<br/><br/>

If you request a feature flag that is not available, you'll receive the default value for that flag. If you always want flags marked as available to the client-side SDK by default, you can check the "Make new flags available to the client-side (JavaScript) SDK by default"
in your [project settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Secure mode

Secure mode ensures that feature flag settings for a user are kept private, and that one user cannot inspect the settings for another user. Secure mode works by having you include a server-generated HMAC SHA256 hash of your user key, signed with the SDK key for your environment.

You can enable secure mode for each environment on your [account settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects) page.

You should send the computed hash for your user in the options array during client initialization:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
var ldclient = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options = {
  hash: "SERVER_GENERATED_HASH"
});
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Each of our server-side SDKs includes a method to compute the secure mode hash for a user. You can pass this to your front-end code in a template. For example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
var ldclient = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options = {
  hash: {{ ldclient.secure_mode_hash(user) }} // this is a template directive, and the ldclient instance here is your server-side SDK client
});
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

To compute the hash yourself, locate the SDK key for your environment on your account settings page. Then, compute an HMAC SHA256 hash of your user key, using your SDK key as a secret.

Here's an example that uses Node.js:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
var crypto = require('crypto');
var hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', 'YOUR_SDK_KEY');
hmac.update('YOUR_USER_KEY');
hash = hmac.digest('hex');
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Tracking click and pageview events

If you've defined click or pageview goals in LaunchDarkly, they'll be sent automatically once the client has been initialized. You do not have to do anything else with the client to send click or pageview goals.

To learn more about click and pageview goals, read [Experimentation](/home/experimentation).

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>Single-page apps</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The SDK automatically handles URL changes (made by the HTML5 history API or by changing the URL hash fragment), and
will trigger pageview and click events correctly.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Tracking custom events

You can record custom events using the `track` function. In LaunchDarkly, you can connect these events to metrics in experiments.

To learn more, read [Experimentation](/home/experimentation).

Call track with the event name to record custom conversion metrics.

The second argument is optional. It assists with observational analytics for Data Export destinations. With Data Export, the second argument gives additional context without saving the data to the LaunchDarkly user.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
ldclient.track("your-event-name", { customProperty: someValue });
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

For numeric metrics, include a numeric value as a third argument in the call.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
ldclient.track("your-event-name", null, 5);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>
