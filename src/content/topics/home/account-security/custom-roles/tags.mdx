# Tags in custom roles

<Metadata timeToRead={props.timeToRead} lastModifiedDateFormatted={props.lastModifiedDateFormatted} />

## Overview

This topic explains how custom roles use tags.

## Understanding tags

Tags are simple strings that you can attach to any resource in LaunchDarkly. Tags are useful for grouping resources into a set that you can name in a resource specifier. For example, you can create a `dev` tag for your environments and use it in a policy to specify custom rules that only apply to development environments.

Tags are supported on the following resources:

- projects
- environments
- segments
- flags

Other resources like metrics, webhooks and integrations do not support tags.

## Adding tags to resources

You can add tags to resources in LaunchDarkly with the UI or API.
