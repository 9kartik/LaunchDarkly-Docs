With the Flag Insights graph, your engineering and product teams have much greater visibility into how many times people are seeing each version of a flag over time, as well as any changes to the flag that could have affected how many times each flag was evaluated.

The Flag Insights graph shows you how changes to flag targeting rules, new variations, or an increased number of users affects how all of your end users are seeing your application.

Each Flag Insights graph also has annotations powered by our enhanced audit log entries to tell you what has changed for your flag and when those changes were made, letting you connect the dots between changes and what your users see.  

Flag Insights graphs are done on a per-flag evaluation basis, not a per-user basis. This means that if the same user is evaluated 20 times, the Flag Insights graph will record and display all 20 evaluations.
