## Overview

This guide explains how LaunchDarkly handles your customers' user data. It outlines different options to configure your product's relationship with LaunchDarkly to minimize or eliminate how often and how much your users' data is transmitted to our servers.

### What's user data?

User data is any information that has specific information about one of your customers or users and is conveyed to LaunchDarkly from your product. This is different from information about your team members, who are authorized users of your LaunchDarkly account.

To learn more about users, read [The user dashboard](./the-user-dashboard).

User data can include personally identifiable information (PII), including names, email addresses, or other unique identifiers. User data can be business-critical information, or can allow other companies to make determinations about your business if exposed. User data is extremely sensitive and depending on the security requirements of your organization, you may want to limit or completely restrict the data you send to LaunchDarkly.
