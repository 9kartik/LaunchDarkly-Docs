## Overview

This topic explains what the **Users** dashboard is, how it is populated, and how to use it.

The Users dashboard gives you a summary view of how each user sees all of the features on your site, and lets you customize their experience from one screen. You can even set expiration dates for flag targeting, or remove flags targeted to individual users.

## Understanding the Users dashboard

The Users dashboard populates automatically when users encounter a feature flag and are evaluated by a LaunchDarkly SDK. The data on the User dashboard is populated from the user data you send in `variation` calls, as well as data from `identify` calls. 

<Callout intent="alert">
  <CalloutTitle>You cannot add users manually</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>
 
You cannot create users in the Users dashboard. The Users dashboard is not a database, and exists to serveusers that have already been evaluated by a LaunchDarkly SDK. Evaluation always happens with the SDK locally on the machine.

</CalloutDescription>

From the Users dashboard, you can filter users by name, key, or e-mail address.

Users live in the dashboard for 30 days from creation. If a user does not evaluate a feature flag within 30 days, they age out of the system and their information no longer appears in the Users dashboard. Those users can reappear on the dashboard when they evaluate a feature flag, provided your account has not reached the maximum number of users.

All accounts are limited to 100,000,000 users. If you hit the 100,000,000 users cap, new users won't appear in the Users dashboard until stale users age out of the 30-day user cache. Users that evaluate a feature flag w/in 30 days of initial population don't age out of the system. If you stop creating a bunch of users at once, 30 days later those stale users are gone. 

To learn more about how the Users dashboard is populated, and how you might exceed the 100,000,000 user limit, read [Anonymous users](/home/managing-users/anonymous-users).

  <CalloutDescription>
 
You can add more users to your LaunchDarkly account if you need to. Your bill will not go up if you add more users to your LaunchDarkly account.<br/><br/>

## Modifying feature flags for a user 

Click a user to manage the feature flags that apply to them and see a full list of their attributes.

To modify a feature flag the user sees:

1. Navigate to the **Users** dashboard.
2. Click the user you wish to modify. Their user page appears, with their unique **Attributes** on the left and their **Flag settings** on the right.

## Scheduling removal dates for user targeting

You can also specify a date and time on which the user should no longer be targeted by this flag. 

To schedule a date for the user to be removed from the flag's targeting settings:

1. Navigate to the **Users** dashboard.
2. Click the user you wish to modify. Their user page appears, with their unique **Attributes** on the left and their **Flag settings** on the right.
3. Click the **three-dot** menu. The user editing menu appears.

4. In the "Remove user on" section, click to expand a calendar view.
4. Set a date and time for the user to be removed from that flag's targeting settings.
5. Click **Save with Comment**.

When you schedule a user to be removed from a flag, a **clock icon** appears next to the flag's varation. Hover over it to see when that user will be removed.

To learn more about targeting users for specific dates, read [Scheduling expiration dates for user targeting](/home/managing-flags/targeting-users#scheduling-removal-dates-for-user-targeting).

## Removing a user 

You can delete individual users from the dashboard by opening their page and clicking the **Delete** button. 

Deleting users from the dashboard does not decrease your Monthly Active User (MAU) count.

<Callout intent="alert">
  <CalloutTitle>Exceeding your Monthly Active Users limit</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>

We never stop or throttle LaunchDarkly services based on your Monthly Active Users (MAU) limits, but we may not save
all user information for users beyond your MAU. For more information about MAU, see [Usage
metrics](/home/metrics-insights/usage-metrics).

You can also use the LaunchDarkly API to delete users. To learn more, read the [API docs](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/reference#delete-user).
