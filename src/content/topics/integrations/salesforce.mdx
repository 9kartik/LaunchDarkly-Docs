## Prerequisites

In order to install and configure the LaunchDarkly Salesforce integration, you must have the following prerequisites:

* You have a LaunchDarkly Enterprise plan
* Your Salesforce role allows you to install appExchange applications and configure connected apps, custom metadata, and page layouts

## Setting up the LaunchDarkly Salesforce integration

<!-- TODO: update link once we are published -->
1. Install the LaunchDarkly Salesforce integration from the [Salesforce AppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com).

2. In Salesforce, click **Setup** and type **Connected Apps** in the **Quick Find** search box on the top left corner of the screen.

3. Select **Manage Connected Apps**.

4. Click **Edit** next to the **LaunchDarkly** connected apps record.

5. In the **OAuth Policies** section, change the **Permitted Users** dropdown to **Admin approved users are pre-authorized** and acknowledge the confirmation that appears.

6. Click **OK** and the click **Save**.

7. From the **Manage Connected Screen** click **LaunchDarkly**, scroll down to the **Profiles** section and click the **Manage Profiles** button.

8. Select the user profiles you wish to grant access to the LaunchDarkly Salesforce app and click **Save**

9. Return to the Salesforce setup dashboard, type **Custom Metadata** in the **Quick Find** search box on the top left corner of the screen.

10. Select **Custom Metadata Types** from the **Custom Code** section.

11. Click **Manage Records** on the **LaunchDarkly Settings** row.

12. Click the **New** button on the **LaunchDarkly Settings** page.

13. In LaunchDarkly, create a new service token with a `reader` role. To learn more, read [Service tokens](/home/account-security/api-access-tokens#service-tokens).

14. Return to Salesforce custom metadata form and create a new **LaunchDarkly Settings** custom metadata record with a **Label** and **LaunchDarkly Settings Name** of "Default" and the **Service Token** from step 13, above.

15. Navigate to a record page for the object type (i.e. Account, Case) you wish to embed the LaunchDarkly Salesforce integration.

16. Click the **gear icon** in the upper right corner and select **Edit Page**.

![The gear icon menu with "Edit page" selected.](../images/salesforce/edit-page.png)

17. Search for **LaunchDarkly** on the **Components** section of the screen and drag the **LaunchDarkly** component onto the page layout. We recommend placing the component in a new tab, but you can place the component anywhere that works best for your team.

18. Fill out the following fields:

    * **Project key** - The key of the LaunchDarkly project you wish to associate with the component.
    * **Environment key** - The key of the LaunchDarkly environment you wish to associate with the component.
    * **Tag** (optional) - The feature flag tag filter you wish to associate with the component. If omitted, all of the project's feature flags will be included in the component.
    * **User key field** - The Salesforce API field name of the record field that maps to LaunchDarkly feature flag evaluation user keys. This can be a built in field, such as `AccountId` or a custom field such as `LaunchDarkly_ID__c`.

19. Navigate back to the sample record page to confirm that the LaunchDarkly integration is visible on the record page.

## Using the LaunchDarkly Salesforce integration

 To get the best experience from the integration, we recommend configuring the **Tag** field in step 18 to a tag in LaunchDarkly that has been applied to around 15 or fewer feature flags. In some cases it may be easier to set the **Tag** field to a new tag like `salesforce` or `customer-facing` and selectively add that tag to the feature flags of your choice in the LaunchDarkly dashboard. Be sure to notify your team members of how this tag is being used so they can selectivity tag any relevant flags. 
 
 To learn more about adding tags to feature flags, read [Other flag settings](home/managing-flags/flag-settings).

## Troubleshooting

### There is a ⚠️ icon at the bottom of the integration

![The LaunchDarkly Salesforce integration with a warning icon visible.](../images/salesforce/integration-with-warning-icon-visible.png)

The ⚠️ icon at the bottom of the integration next to the **User**, means LaunchDarkly has not observed any flag evaluations for this user in the past 30 days. Unless the user is new or inactive, this could be a sign that the **User key field** in step 18 above has been misconfigured. The **User key field** should mapped to a field on the Salesforce record page that represents the **Key** used to evaluate feature flags. If you are unsure what the **Key** field should look like, visit the [Users dashboard](home/managing-users/users-dashboard) and inspect the **Key** column.

### Cannot load flag data for user because 'Field' is empty.

![The LaunchDarkly Salesforce integration displaying the "cannot load flag data" error message.](../images/salesforce/cannot-load-flag-data-error.png)

This message means the current record page does not have anything set in the **User key field** set in step 18. above. If you do not wish to see this message on records that do not have the **User key field** filled out, consider configuring a component visibility rule on the Salesforce Lightning App builder page. To learn more, read [Dynamic lightning pages](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=lightning_page_components_visibility.htm).

### No such column 'User key field' exists on entity 'Record'.

![The LaunchDarkly Salesforce integration displaying the "no such column" error message.](../images/salesforce/no-such-column-error.png)

This message means the **User key field** specified in step 18 above does not exist on the record page. To see all available API fields do the following:
1. Click the **Gear icon** on the top right corner of the page and click **Setup**

2. Click on the **Object Manager** tab and click the record of interest (i.e. Account, Case).

3. Click **Fields & Relationships**. The **User key field** in step 18 can be configured to anything in the **Field Name** column of this page.
