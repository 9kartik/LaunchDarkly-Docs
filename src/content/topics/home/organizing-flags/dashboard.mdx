## Overview

This topic explains how to use the dashboard, the core interface of LaunchDarkly platform. The dashboard shows your feature flags and gives you many options to create, modify, and manage them.

## Viewing feature flags

When you create a new feature flag, it appears on the dashboard in each of your environments. Similarly, deleting a feature flag removes it from all the environments in your project.

To learn more, read [Creating a feature flag](/home/getting-started/feature-flags).

Use the search bar to filter by flag name, tag, key, or description, or create a new feature flag by clicking **+ Flag**.
