## Overview

This topic explains how to use the Slack webhook integration to set up [Slack Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks) to receive any activities in LaunchDarkly. When something is changed (e.g. when a feature flag is updated, when a new team member is invited to LaunchDarkly, and more) we'll send an incoming webhook to Slack.

  <CalloutDescription>

LaunchDarkly has developed a [new Slack app](/integrations/slack) which is more powerful and easier to use than the Slack
webhooks integration.

The content below describes the older webhook-based integration.

## Creating a Slack incoming hook

First, create an incoming hook in Slack. To do this, head to the [Incoming Webhooks](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/) page in Slack, select a channel, and click Add Incoming WebHooks integration.

Copy the Webhook URL, and in LaunchDarkly, navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/integrations), and click **+ Integration** in the chat integrations section.

## Adding a policy filter

By default, room notifications set up without a policy filter will receive a notification for any change in LaunchDarkly (across any project, environment, goal, feature flag, etc.). You can optionally specify a policy (using the same syntax as our [Custom roles](/home/team/custom-roles) feature to filter the events sent to your room.

For example, if you only want to receive an event when a change is made to one of your production feature flags, you can add the following policy to your room notification:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Policy', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
[{
  "effect": "allow",
  "resources": [
    "proj/*:env/production:flag/*"
  ],
  "actions": [
    "*"
  ]
}]
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Disabling a Slack incoming webhook

You can temporarily disable a Slack incoming webhook by hitting the On/Off switch on the [Integrations](https://app.launchdarkly.com/integrations) page.
