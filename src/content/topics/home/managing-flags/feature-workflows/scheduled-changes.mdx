## Overview

This topic explains how to schedule flag changes to take effect at a date in the future.

Scheduling flag changes allows you to define and schedule changes to your flag’s targeting rules for future points in time. While this sounds simple, it unlocks the potential to create a progressive delivery strategy by scheduling the incremental steps to release your feature to 100% of your user base.

For example, you may want to schedule the feature to turn on for internal testing two days from today, then enable it for your ‘beta’ customer segment four days later, and finally start an automated rollout from 0% to 100% over the following five days. Now you can define this feature workflow ahead of time and be confident that it will take effect at the specified date and time.

## Benefits of scheduling flag changes

1. **Timing an early launch**: LaunchDarkly users no longer need to set reminders or wake up early to turn a flag ON. Scheduling your flag to turn on on a specified date/time allows you to plan your release and let LaunchDarkly do the rest.
2. **Progressive feature rollouts**: Using this functionality, you can schedule your flag to roll out to 20% of your user base tomorrow, 35% the day after, 50% the day after that, and increase that percentage until it reaches 100%. This only requires creating a set of scheduled changes to your flag once and lets you slowly release features and ensure they’re performing the way you hoped they would.
3. **Temporary user access**: You can now schedule rules that target certain users and segments to be added to or removed from your flag’s targeting to better manage user access.
4. **Flag hygiene**: You can schedule your flag’s targeting rules to clean up once your flag has been rolled out to 100% of your users, to practice better flag hygiene and more easily understand the flag's configuration.

## Creating scheduled flag changes

To schedule a set of flag changes:

1. Navigate to the flag dashboard and select the flag for which you want to schedule targeting changes. The flag's Targeting tab appears.
2. Make the changes you want to the flag’s targeting.
3. Click the dropdown next to the **Save changes** button and select **Schedule Changes**.

4. In the "Schedule change for" section, click on **Select a date** to expand a calendar view.

5. Set a date and time for when you want the changes to execute. 
6. Click **Apply**.
7. Review and confirm the changes displayed in the modal. If you need to make changes, click **Edit**, change what you need, and then click **Done**.

8. Enter a comment and the environment name.
9. Click **Schedule Changes**. Your changes have now been scheduled. 

You can schedule multiple changes for a single flag for different dates and times.

For example, you can implement a progressive rollout strategy by scheduling multiple sequential changes to targeting rules.

## Viewing scheduled flag changes

To view all the scheduled changes for a flag:

1. Navigate to the flag dashboard and select the flag for which you want to view the scheduled changes. The flag's Targeting tab appears.
2. The number of scheduled changes appear in the upper right corner.

3. To view the complete list of changes, click on the clock icon. A drawer opens that displays all the pending changes that are scheduled for this flag. The changes are listed chronologically, with the earliest upcoming change listed first.

4. A modal appears with the list of scheduled flag changes. 
5. You can change the schedule by changing the date or time for these changes. Alternatively, you can click **Edit** to make updates and click **Done** when complete.
6. Type in a comment and the environment name.
7. Hit **Update Change** to save your updates to the scheduled change.

## Deleting scheduled flag changes

## Managing conflicts with scheduled changes

It’s possible that as you schedule a change to about flag, another user introduces a breaking change, or a conflict. 

Conflicts occur for two reasons:
* Another user updated the flag’s targeting that invalidates one or more of your scheduled changes
* Another user scheduled a set of conflicting changes to be executed before your changes

LaunchDarkly warns users in the UI when they save or schedule changes to the flag that introduce conflicts with other pending scheduled changes.

![A notification showing a conflicting scheduled change.](../../images/workflows-conflict.png)

Despite this warning, a user could decide to save their conflicting changes anyway. 

If this happens, LaunchDarkly sends an email notification to the user whose changes now conflict. That user's changes will not take effect at the time and date they scheduled. 

### Resolving conflicts in scheduled changes

If your scheduled changes conflict with other changes, you receive an email notification.

![The email notification users with conflicting changes receive.](../../images/workflows-email.png)

You can resolve the conflict and ensure your scheduled changes don’t fail in one of two ways.

1. **Choose one of the two conflicting changes and delete the other.** For example, you may have scheduled 3 targeting rules to be updated and someone deletes 1 of those rules, which causes a conflict. If this happens, you can update your scheduled changes to delete the scheduled changes to that rule. This ensures that the conflict is resolved and the remaining rules are updating successfully.
2. **Update the conflicting changes so they no longer conflict.** You can update your changes or the new scheduled changes to resolve the conflict and ensure both scheduled changes execute successfully.  

## Scheduling changes that match current flags

You can schedule a change that matches the current state of the flag. To do this, stage placeholder changes and then edit the actions when you schedule them.

Here is an example showing how you can schedule your flag to turn `off` for an hour, and then turn back `on`.

1. Turn flag targeting `off`.
2. Click into the **Save Changes** dropdown and choose **Schedule changes**.
3. Click **Edit**.
4. Turn the flag to `on`.
5. Click **Done** and schedule the change.

This workaround lets you schedule changes to your flag that are not different from the flag's current state. This is useful to help schedule changes that restore the flag’s state after an interval.
