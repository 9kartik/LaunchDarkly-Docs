## Overview

This topic explains how to create and implement custom roles and policies in LaunchDarkly.

Custom roles are very flexible. You can create a custom role with broad or precise permissions and apply it to one or more members in your team.

To configure a custom role:

1. [Create a custom role](#creating-a-custom-role)
2. [Create one or more policies for that custom role](#creating-policies-for-roles-and-resources)
3. [Give one or more team members to that custom role](#giving-a-member-a-custom-role)

## Creating a custom role

Before you can give a team member custom permissions in LaunchDarkly, you must create a custom role to give them.

2. Click into the **Roles** tab.
3. Click **New Role**. The "Create a role" screen appears.

5. Enter a **Key** for the role.
6. (Optional) Enter a **Description** to explain what the role does.
7. (Optional) Create a policy in the "Policy" fields.
8. Click **Save Role**.

## Creating policies for roles and resources

Policies are sets of actions a custom role is allowed or not allowed to take. You can create policies from the **Roles** tab.

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>Write policies by hand in the Advanced editor</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>

Advanced users can write custom policies of their own with the Advanced editor. To learn more about writing your own
policies, read [Policies in custom roles](/home/account-security/custom-roles/policies).

  </CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

To create a policy:

1. Complete the steps in [Creating a custom role](#creating-a-custom-role).
2. In the "Create a role" screen, click into the **Resources** field.
3. Specify a resource this policy affects.

## Giving a member a custom role

After you have created a custom role and policies for it, you must give that role to all members to whom you wish it to apply.

To give a member a custom role:

1. Navigate to **Account Settings**.
2. Click into the **Team** tab and find the team member you wish to give a custom role.
3. Click **Edit** beside that team member's name. The member's Settings page opens.

<Callout intent="alert">
  <CalloutTitle>Add members individually</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>

You must add a custom role to one member at a time. You may not apply a role to multiple members simultaneously.

For example, if you wish to add a role for the QA team, you must find each QA team member and add the role to each member individually.

Use the "Role policy details" screen to view detailed information about a custom role, including which projects and feature flags the role has permission to modify. You can also see each action the custom role can perform and what that action does.
