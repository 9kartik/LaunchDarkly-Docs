## Overview

This topic explains how to use the LaunchDarkly New Relic integration to view LaunchDarkly events in New Relic. [New Relic](https://www.newrelic.com/) is an [application performance management (APM)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_performance_management) tool that allows customers to monitor the operational health of their application and infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

To configure the integration, you must create an API key on your New Relic account. 

To learn more, read [New Relic's documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/introduction-event-api#register).

## Configuring LaunchDarkly to work with New Relic

To configure LaunchDarkly to send events to New Relic:

1. Navigate to the Integrations page and find the "New Relic" card.

3. Give the integration a human-readable **Name**.

4. Paste in your [**New Relic account ID**](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id). This can be found in the URL of your New Relic account right after `/accounts/`.

5. Paste in your [**New Relic API key**](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/introduction-event-api#register).

6. Click **Save New Relic Configuration**.

### Adding custom policies to the New Relic integration 

By default, the New Relic integration sends production flag change events to
New Relic. You can customize those events with the policy editor using the same
language and construction as if you were creating a custom role.

To learn more, read [Custom Roles](/home/account-security/custom-roles).

You can customize the events LaunchDarkly sends to New Relic by using the policy
editor in the New Relic configuration panel:

## Accessing LaunchDarkly events in New Relic

To view LaunchDarkly events in New Relic Insights, navigate to your Insights homepage and type in the query `SELECT * FROM LaunchDarkly`. 

This query shows all LaunchDarkly-generated events generated in the last hour. You can customize the timeframe to display events from a different period if you choose.
