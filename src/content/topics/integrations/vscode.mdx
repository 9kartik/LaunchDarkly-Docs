## Overview

This topic explains how to use the LaunchDarkly VSCode extension to interact with feature flags from within VSCode.

With the extension, you'll get the ability to:

- See a tooltip with feature flag details when you hover over a feature flag key in your source code
- Autocomplete feature flag keys
- Open feature flags in LaunchDarkly (Default keybinding: ctrl+alt+g/âŒ˜+alt+g) 


## Installing the VSCode extension

To install the VSCode extension, visit the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=launchdarkly.launchdarkly).

## Extension settings

On installation of the LaunchDarkly extension, VSCode prompts you to configure the extension, including selecting a LaunchDarkly project and environment for your workspace. 

To reconfigure the extension, run the "LaunchDarkly: Configure" command from the command pallete. 

To learn about additional settings, read the extension's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-vscode/blob/master/README.md#installation-and-configuration).

*Note: If you use quick suggestions to autocomplete words, LaunchDarkly autocomplete functionality requires the `editor.quickSuggestions.strings` setting to be enabled. Otherwise, you'll need to press Ctrl+Space (default binding) to see your flag key suggestions.

Here's an example configuration with quick suggestions enabled:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
{
  "editor.quickSuggestions": {
    "other": true,
    "comments": false,
    "strings": true
  },
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>
