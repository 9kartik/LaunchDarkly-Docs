## Understanding LaunchDarkly's built-in privacy features

LaunchDarkly has a robust offering of privacy features in a basic out-of-the-box configuration. Review the features below to see if LaunchDarkly meets your privacy requirements without additional configuration.

### End-to-end encryption

LaunchDarkly uses end-to-end encryption for every interaction. We employ multiple levels of encryption for security, authentication, data privacy, and data consistency.

All incoming and outgoing traffic passing between LaunchDarkly and other apps or software over public networks is encrypted with [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS). Data stored on disk or in cold storage is encrypted with [AES256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard).

### Client-side and server-side SDKs

LaunchDarkly's client- and server-side SDKs use different constraints to maintain user privacy. Client-side SDKs typically run on customers' own devices, where they can be compromised by users who examine SDK bytecode or inspect internal site data.

Because of these concerns, client-side SDKs depend on LaunchDarkly's servers to safely store flag rules, rather than storing them locally. Flag rules can include user data or PII, so limiting them to exist only on servers protects that information from being compromised. Additionally,

## Do Not Track

Modern web browsers have Do Not Track options that prevent websites, apps, and services from harvesting user data. You can enable Do Not Track in your browser to keep individual user events about your actions from being sent to LaunchDarkly. This will not negatively impact your experience; it just means that LaunchDarkly will not see events with your PII associated with them.

## Ad blockers

You can enable a third-party ad blocker in your browser to prevent identifying information from user events from being sent to LaunchDarkly.

    Some ad blockers may impact how feature flags work in the browser. Ad blockers are made by third-party companies. If
    you experience unexpected behavior and believe it's connected to an ad blocker, [contact
