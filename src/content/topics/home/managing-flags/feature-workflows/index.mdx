## Overview

With feature workflows, you can elevate your use of feature flags by creating complex workflows within LaunchDarkly. Workflows map to how your teams build, ship, and control software. You can also define custom release strategies that seamlessly integrate LaunchDarkly with your organization’s existing tools and processes, so every team can benefit from better feature management.

Feature workflows start with three powerful building blocks: **Scheduling**, **Approvals**, and **Flag triggers**.
