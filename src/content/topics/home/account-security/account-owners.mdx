## Overview

This topic explains how to change which team member has the `owner` role in your LaunchDarkly account, as well as what the `owner` role entails. 

In LaunchDarkly, `owner` is a unique role that only one team member can have. Owners have absolute power over your entire LaunchDarkly project, including the ability to give or remove `admin` privileges from other team members, or to remove the `owner` role from themselves and assign it to someone else. 

Every LaunchDarkly account must have an `owner`. By default, the person who creates your LaunchDarkly account is designated as the owner.

To learn more about member roles, read [Managing your team](/home/account-security/managing-your-team).

## Changing account owners

1. Log in to LaunchDarkly as the account `owner`.
2. Navigate to the **Account settings** screen and click into the **Team** tab.
3. Scroll down to the "Account owner" section.
4. Click your name. A dropdown list of other team members appears.

Your permissions change to `admin`. The team member you chose is now the `owner`.
