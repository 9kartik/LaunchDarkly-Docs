## Overview

This topic explains how to reset your LaunchDarkly password, and what to do if you do not receive a reset email.

In order to follow these instructions, you must have a LaunchDarkly account that does not have single sign-on (SSO) enabled.

If you sign in to LaunchDarkly though a SSO provider, such as Okta, Google, or your organization's SSO, you can reset your password through that provider. To learn more, read [Single sign-on](/home/account-security/sso).

## Resetting your password

To reset your LaunchDarkly password:

1. Navigate to the [LaunchDarkly login page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/login).
2. Enter the email address associated with your LaunchDarkly account.
3. Click **Next**.
4. Click the **Forgot your password?** link.
5. Enter your email address again.
6. Click **Reset my password**.
7. Check your email account for a password reset email with instructions.

## Password reset problems

You may encounter problems resetting your password, depending on how your account is set up.

### Your reset link has expired

Password reset links expire after one hour. If your password reset link has expired, request a new reset link by following the instructions in [Resetting your password](#resetting-your-password).

### You did not receive a reset email

If you did not receive a password reset email after requesting a password reset, the issue may be one of the following:

- Your team uses SSO to authenticate into LaunchDarkly. If so, reset your password through your third-party SSO platform.
- You have not accepted the initial invitation to your team's LaunchDarkly account. If so, accept the invitation to your team's LaunchDarkly account, or, if the invitation is more than seven days old, request a new invitation from your LaunchDarkly administrator.
- Your company's email server filters out or rejects password reset emails from LaunchDarkly. If so, check with your IT team to find out if your server filtered or rejected the email.

If you are still not receiving password reset emails, contact us at support@launchdarkly.com.
