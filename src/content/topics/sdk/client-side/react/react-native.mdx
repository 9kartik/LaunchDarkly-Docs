<Callout intent="alert">
  <CalloutTitle>SDK version compatibility</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The latest version of the SDK is compatible with Xcode 11.4 and React Native 0.63. For compatibility with earlier React Native versions, please refer to older SDK versions.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

This reference guide documents all of the methods available in our React Native SDK, and explains in detail how these methods work. If you want to dig even deeper, our SDKs are open source. To learn more, read [React Native SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/react-native-client-sdk). The online [API docs](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-native-client-sdk/) contain the programmatic definitions of every type and method. Additionally you can clone and run a [sample application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-react-native) using this SDK.

To learn more about the specific configuration options that are available in this SDK, read the [SDK's API docs](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-native-client-sdk/index.html#ldclientconfig).

## Getting Started

<Callout intent="warning">
  <CalloutTitle>Expo usage</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The LaunchDarkly React Native Client SDK does not work with Expo because the SDK uses native modules. Please consider using [ExpoKit](https://docs.expo.io/expokit/expokit/).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Building on top of our [Getting Started guide](/home/getting-started), the following steps will get you started with using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your React Native code.

The first step is to install the LaunchDarkly SDK as a dependency. Add the LaunchDarkly npm dependency to your project and link it to your React Native project.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'Installing with npm', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```bash
npm install --save launchdarkly-react-native-client-sdk
cd ios/
pod install
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

You will need a `Podfile` in your `ios/` directory. Once you've written your `Podfile`, run `pod install` in the `ios/` directory. This SDK currently requires Xcode 10.2.1 (it is compatible with Xcode 10.3) and is compiled against Swift 5.

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle><code>use_frameworks!</code> and undefined symbols errors</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>As of v2.1.0 <code>use_frameworks!</code> is not necessary in the Podfile. If you encounter an undefined symbols error when building without <code>use_frameworks!</code> in your <code>Podfile</code> you will need to create a new empty Swift file and accept the prompt to create a matching Objective-C bridging header. If you are building for multiple platforms, add those as targets for the bridging header. If you're still having trouble resolving the undefined symbols error, clean and rebuild and try again.</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

end
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Once the SDK is downloaded and saved in `package.json` and the other install steps are complete, you'll need to import it into your project:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
import LDClient from 'launchdarkly-react-native-client-sdk';
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Once the SDK is installed and imported, you'll want to create a single, shared instance of LDClient, passing in the client and user configuration objects. To create a client instance, you need your environment's mobile key (available on your [account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects)). Mobile keys are not secret. You can expose them in your client-side code with no risk.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
let client = new LDClient();
let clientConfig = { "mobileKey": "YOUR_MOBILE_KEY" };
let userConfig = { "key": "user_key" };

await client.configure(clientConfig, userConfig);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Lastly, when your application is about to terminate, shut down LDClient. This ensures that the client releases any resources it is using, and that any pending analytics events are delivered to LaunchDarkly. If your application quits without this shutdown step, you may not see your requests and users on the dashboard, because they are derived from analytics events. This is something you only need to do once.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
client.close();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>Mobile keys</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Be sure to use a mobile key from your [Environments](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/environments) page.

Never embed a server-side SDK key into a mobile application.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Client Configuration Options

You can also pass custom parameters to the client by creating a custom configuration object:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
let clientConfig =
  { "mobileKey": "YOUR_MOBILE_KEY",
    "connectionTimeoutMillis": 3000
  };
await client.configure(clientConfig, userConfig);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The `clientConfig` object can include a variety of options. `mobileKey` is a required property, but all other properties are optional. To learn more about the specific configuration options that are available in this SDK, read the [SDK's API docs](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-native-client-sdk/index.html#ldclientconfig).

## User Configuration Options

Here is a complete user configuration object utilizing all available fields:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
let userConfig =
  { key: '2fbfa269b78e24c8e967f482b89c939b',
    name: 'grace_hopper',
    firstName: 'Grace',
    lastName: 'Hopper',
    email: 'gracehopper@example.net',
    anonymous: false,
    privateAttributeNames: ['name'],
    country: 'USA',
    custom: {'groups': 'users'}
  };
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Let's walk through this code. The first key in the object is the user's key. In this case we've used the value `2fbfa269b78e24c8e967f482b89c939b`. The user key is the only mandatory user attribute. The key should also uniquely identify each user. You can use any value such as a primary key, an e-mail address, or a hash, as long as the same user always has the same key. We recommend using a hash if possible.

All of the other keys (like firstName, email, and the custom attributes) are optional. The attributes you specify will automatically appear on the LaunchDarkly application dashboard, meaning that you can start segmenting and targeting users with these attributes.

In addition to built-in attributes like names and e-mail addresses, you can pass us any of your own user data by passing custom attributes, like the groups attribute in the example above. Custom attributes are one of the most powerful features of LaunchDarkly. They let you target users according to any data that you want to send to us, including organizations, groups, andaccount plans. Anything you pass to us becomes available instantly on your dashboard.

Private attributes allow you to specify keys you do not want to be sent to the LaunchDarkly servers. Private user attributes can be used for targeting purposes, but are removed from the user data sent back to LaunchDarkly. When this user is sent back to LaunchDarkly, the `name` attribute will be removed.

The `anonymous` key allows you to distinguish logged out or unregistered users while still using LaunchDarkly. Anonymous users work just like regular users, except that they won't appear on your Users page in LaunchDarkly. This keeps anonymous users from polluting your Users page.

You can't search for anonymous users on your Features page, and you can't search or autocomplete by anonymous user keys. If you use the same user key for every anonymous user, you also can't use percentage rollouts or Experimentation with anonymous users.

We recommend using the same user key for every initialization and then replacing that with the actual user key when you know who the user is. This way LaunchDarkly counts the initialization user key only once against your MAU, instead of every time you initialize.

## Variations
The variation method determines whether a flag is enabled or not for a specific user. In React Native, there is a variation method for each type (e.g. `boolVariation`,` stringVariation`):

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
let jsonResult = await client.jsonVariation('MY_JSON_FLAG_KEY', {});
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Variation calls take the feature flag key and a fallback value.

The fallback value will only be returned if an error is encountered. For example, the default value returns if the feature flag key doesn't exist or the user doesn't have a key specified.

The variation call will automatically create a user in LaunchDarkly if a user with that user key doesn't exist already. There's no need to create users ahead of their initial use, but if you choose to do so, you can use the `identify` method to do so.

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>Handling flag values on initial application launch</CalloutTitle>
 <CalloutDescription>
When LDClient is initialized for the first time at app launch, users receive feature flag fallback values until an initial connection to LaunchDarkly is completed for the first time. Read the section above for various ways to initialize the client.</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

<Callout intent="alert">
  <CalloutTitle>Making feature flags available to this SDK</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>
You must make feature flags available to client-side SDKs before the flags can be evaluated. If you evaluate a feature flag that is not available, you will receive the default value for that flag. If you want a project's flags to be made available to this SDK by default, check the **SDKs using Mobile Key** checkbox in your project [Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects).
  </CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## VariationDetail

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>Availability</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>Since v2.1.0</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

The `variationDetail` methods work the same as `variation`, but also provide additional `reason` information about how a flag value was calculated (for instance, if the user matched a specific rule). You can examine the `reason` data programmatically; you can also view it with data export, if you are capturing detailed analytics events for this flag.

For more information, see [Evaluation reasons](/sdk/concepts/evaluation-reasons).

## All Flags

<Callout intent="alert">
  <CalloutTitle>Creating users</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Unlike `variation` and `identify` calls, `allFlags` does not send events to LaunchDarkly. When you use `allFlags`, users are not created or updated in the LaunchDarkly dashboard.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

The `allFlags` method returns an object containing flag keys and values. You may also register a listener that will fire when any flag in your environment changes.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
let allFlagsResult = client.allFlags();
allFlagsResult.then(values => {
  console.log(values);
});

// All Flags Listener
let listenerId = "ARBITRARY_VALUE"
let listener = value => Alert.alert('All Flags Listener Callback', value);
client.registerAllFlagsListener(listenerId, listener);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Track

The `track` method allows you to record actions your users take in your app. In the LaunchDarkly dashboard, you can tie these events to goals in A/B tests. You can also attach custom JSON data to your event by passing an extra parameter to `track`. Here's a simple example:

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>Availability</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>Since v2.1.0</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

You can now optionally add a `metricValue` parameter to the `track` method if you are using the latest version of Experimentation.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
client.track('MY_GOAL_FLAG_KEY', false);
client.track('MY_GOAL_FLAG_KEY_WITH_DATA', {'some_data':'value'});
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Offline Mode
In some situations, you might want to stop making remote calls to LaunchDarkly and switch to the last known values for your feature flags. Offline mode lets you do this easily.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
let offlineResult = client.setOffline(); //true or false
let offlineStatus = client.isOffline(); //true or false
let onlineResult = client.setOnline(); //true or false
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>Lack of network connectivity</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If a user's device is in airplane/flight mode or if they are not connected to a network, LaunchDarkly will use the latest stored flag settings in memory. If there are no previously stored flag settings, then the fallback values will be used.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Flush

Internally, the LaunchDarkly SDK keeps an event buffer for `track` calls. These are flushed periodically in a background thread. In some situations (for example, if you're testing out the SDK in a simulator), you may want to manually call `flush` to process events immediately.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
client.flush();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Identify

If your app is used by multiple users on a single device, you may want to change users and have separate flag settings for each user. To achieve this, the SDK will store the last 5 user contexts on a single device, with support for switching between different user contexts.

You can use the `identify` method to switch user contexts:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
let user = {'key': 'minimal_user'};
await client.identify(user); //promise resolves to nil/null
Alert.alert('identify', 'success');
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The `identify` call will load any saved flag values for the new user and immediately trigger an update of the latest flags from LaunchDarkly.

## Real-time Updates

LaunchDarkly manages all flags for a user context in real-time by updating flags based on a real-time event stream. When a flag is modified from the LaunchDarkly dashboard, the flag values for the current user will update almost immediately.

To accomplish real-time updates, LaunchDarkly broadcasts an event stream that is listened to by the React Native SDK. Whenever an event is performed on the dashboard, the React Native SDK is notified of the updated flag settings in real-time.

To perform real-time updates in your app, your app will need to register listeners for each flag you'd like to watch:


<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
if (this.state.listeners.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
  return;
}
let listener = value => Alert.alert('Listener Callback', value);
client.registerFeatureFlagListener('MY_LISTEN_FLAG_KEY', listener);
this.setState({listeners: {...this.state.listeners, ...{['MY_LISTEN_FLAG_KEY']: listener}}});
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Similarly you can unregister listeners to disable them:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
this.state.ldClient.unregisterFeatureFlagListener('MY_LISTEN_FLAG_KEY', this.state.listeners['MY_LISTEN_FLAG_KEY']);
let {['MY_LISTEN_FLAG_KEY']: omit, ...newListeners} = this.state.listeners;
this.setState({listeners: newListeners});
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Background Fetch
The React Native SDK defaults to the background fetch behavior for the platform it's running on.

## Monitoring SDK Status
The React Native SDK exposes some of its internal status through the Connection Status API to allow your application to monitor the SDK's status. This is provided primarily as a mechanism for the application to determine how recently the internal flag cache has been updated with the most recent values, as well as diagnosing potential reasons for the flag cache to be out of date. Please see the documentation for iOS or Android Connection Status for detailed explanation of the information available on that platform.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
let connectionInformation = client.getConnectionInformation();
console.log("Connection Information: " + connectionInformation);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>
