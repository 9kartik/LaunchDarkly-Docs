## Overview

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Flag triggers is an Enterprise feature</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

This topic explains how to use LaunchDarkly's triggers feature with Honeycomb. For example, you can create an alert in Honeycomb that uses a trigger to toggle a flag on or off if a performance metric drops below a certain threshold.

To learn more about how Honeycomb uses triggers, read [Honeycomb's documentation](https://docs.honeycomb.io/working-with-your-data/triggers/).

## Prerequisites

In order to complete this topic, you must meet the following prerequisites.

* You must have a feature flag with a trigger. 
* You must have access to the trigger's URL, which you copied and saved during the trigger creation process. To learn more, read [Triggers](/integrations/triggers).
* You must have an existing [Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io/) account. 

## Connecting a flag trigger to Honeycomb

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Honeycomb triggers and LaunchDarkly triggers are two different terms</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Honeycomb uses similar nomenclature to LaunchDarkly when discribing actions controlled by webhooks and third-party tools. However, a trigger in Honeycomb is not synonymous as a trigger in LaunchDarkly. 

In this topic, we distinguish between the two triggers with the labels "Honeycomb trigger" and "LaunchDarkly trigger."

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

To connect a LaunchDarkly trigger to your Honeycomb account, you must peform two actions:

1. Create an integration in Honeycomb that includes your LaunchDarkly trigger, and
2. Make a Honeycomb trigger based on configuration you specify that uses the LaunchDarkly trigger to perform flag actions.

### Creating an integration in Honeycomb

1. Log into Honeycomb.
2. Click your username, and then click **Team settings**.
3. Click into the **Integrations** tab.
4. In the "Trigger Recipients" section, click **Add integration**.
5. In the "Provider" section, choose "Webhook" as the type of integration you want to configure.
6. Give your webhook a human-readable **Name**.
7. Paste the LaunchDarkly trigger URL into the **Webhook URL** field.
8. Enter any text into the **Shared secret** field.
9. Click **Add.**

### Associating the integration with an alert

Now you must associate the integration you created with a Honeycomb trigger.

1. Navigate to the query you want to connect to a LaunchDarkly trigger.
2. Click the **three-dot** overflow menu. A dropdown appears.
4. Click **Make Trigger**.
5. Give your trigger a human-readable **Name**.
6. Make any configuration you need until you get to the "Recipients" section. 
7. In the "Recipients" section, click **Add Recipient** and choose **Webhook -- [Your webhook's name]** from the dropdown.
8. Confirm this is what you want and click **Add**.
9. Click **Create trigger**. 

Now alerts in your Honeycomb account will trigger feature flags in LaunchDarkly.
