# Getting started with SDKs

<Metadata timeToRead={props.timeToRead} lastModifiedDateFormatted={props.lastModifiedDateFormatted} />

## Overview

This topic explains the prerequisites you must consider when you're setting up a LaunchDarkly SDK
for the first time.

## Prerequisites

Regardless of which SDK you use, everyone who integrates LaunchDarkly with their code must consider
the following prerequisites. Making decisions about the items listed below will help you use feature
flags in a way that makes sense for your use case, customers, security considerations, and existing
network architecture.

Consider the following factors when you're starting to integrate LaunchDarkly SDKs with your code:

1. Determine what kind of SDK you need to use.

Depending on your use case, you may need a server-side, client-side, or mobile SDK.
You only need one SDK per application or service. You can use multiple SDKs if your product is comprised
of applications or services written in multiple languages. You do not need multiple SDKs to support
frontend and backend behavior, but we support this configuration if it works best for you. To learn more
about SDKs, read [Client-side and server-side SDKs](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/).
