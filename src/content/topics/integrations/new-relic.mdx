# New Relic

## Overview

This topic explains how to use the New Relic integration to annotate New Relic transactions with feature flag information. You can use this data to correlate feature flag variations with changes in application performance or error rates.

## Adding the New Relic integration

LaunchDarkly SDKs automatically detect whether you have New Relic installed without any additional configuration steps. If LaunchDarkly detects New Relic,
LaunchDarkly adds a [custom attribute](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/insights-custom-attributes) for every feature flag request call made within a New Relic transaction trace.

You can see custom attributes for particular transactions on your New Relic dashboard, or use [NRQL](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference) to explore how feature flags impact performance across many transactions.
