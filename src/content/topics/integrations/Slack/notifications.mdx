## Overview

This topic explains how to subscribe to flag notifications in Slack channels.

It can be useful to let an entire channel know when a flag changes. You can subscribe Slack channels to notifications from individual flags or the entire set of flags associated with a filter as described in the previous topic.

For more information about filter-based notifications, see [Managing Flags with the Slack App](/integrations/slack/managing-flags).

## Understanding update notifications in channels

When a flag is updated, either directly in LaunchDarkly or through the Slack app, a notification of the change is sent to any channel subscribed to updates for that flag.

The notification includes the following information:

- The name of the person who made the change
- The name of the flag
- The environment, project, and key of the flag
- A comment about the change, if applicable

Click **View Flag** to visit the Flag Overview screen.

You can subscribe to updates from specific flags so you receive notifications when the flag changes.

When you view filter results in a channel, you can subscribe to updates from any flag in that set of results. When the flag is changed, either through the LaunchDarkly UI or the Slack app, a notification appears in any channel subscribed to that flag.

For more information about filtering flags, see [Viewing, Monitoring, and Subscribing to Flags](/integrations/slack/managing-flags).

To add a flag to a channel:

1. Open the Slack channel where you wish notifications about a flag to appear.
2. Type `/launchdarkly` in your Slack client's text bar and press **Enter**. The LaunchDarkly Slack app appears.
3. Find the flag you wish to subscribe to by filtering in the Slack app.
4. Click **Add to Channel** in the dropdown menu next to the flag you wish to subscribe to.
5. The channel receives a notification that the flag has been added to that channel.

## Removing flag notifications from a channel

You are able to remove Flags from a channel so that you no longer receive notifications when the flag changes.

1. Open the Slack channel where you wish notifications about a flag to appear.
2. Type `/launchdarkly` in your Slack client's text bar and press **Enter**. The LaunchDarkly Slack app appears.
3. Click **List Channel Flags**. A list of the flags sending associated with the channel appears.
4. Locate the flag you wish to remove from the channel.
5. Select **Remove from channel** in the dropdown menu beside the name of the flag.
6. Once the subscription is removed, the entire channel receives a notification of the change.
