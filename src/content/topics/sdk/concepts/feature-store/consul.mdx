<Callout intent="alert">
  <CalloutTitle>Data size limit in Consul</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>

Consul does not support storing values greater than 512KB. Using Consul as a persistent feature store does not work if the JSON representation of any feature flag or user segment exceeds that size. To learn more about these limitations, read [Consul's documentation](https://www.consul.io/docs/faq#q-what-is-the-per-key-value-size-limitation-for-consul-s-key-value-store).

To see the JSON representations of all flags and segments, query <code>https://app.launchdarkly.com/sdk/latest-all</code> with your SDK key in the `Authorization` header.

Many of our server-side SDKs support Consul. To learn more, read "Platform-specific notes" below.

In the following examples, the Consul feature store is set to use a host address of `my-consul:8100`, a prefix string of `"my-key-prefix"`, and a cache TTL of 30 seconds.

## Platform-specific notes

- **C**: There is no Consul integration for the C server-side SDK.
- **Haskell**: Currently there is no Consul integration for the Haskell server-side SDK.
- **Go**: This integration is in [`github.com/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk-consul`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk-consul) for version 5.0.0 or higher of the SDK. In versions 4.5.0 and higher, but below 5.0.0, it is in the main SDK distribution as the subpackage `ldconsul`.
- **Java**: You must install the additional package [`com.launchdarkly.launchdarkly-java-server-sdk-consul-store`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/java-server-sdk-consul).
- **.NET**: You must install the additional package [`LaunchDarkly.ServerSdk.Consul`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/dotnet-server-sdk-consul).
- **Node.js**: You must install the additional package [`launchdarkly-node-server-consul`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/node-server-sdk-consul).
- **PHP**: This integration is part of the main SDK distribution as of version 3.5.0, but you must also install the package `aws/sensiolabs/consul-php-sdk`.
- **Python**: This integration is part of the main SDK distribution as of version 6.8.1, but you must also install the package `python-consul`. Python 3.3 and 3.4 are not supported.
- **Ruby**: This integration is part of the main SDK distribution as of version 5.1.1, but you must also install the gem `diplomat`.

## How the SDKs store data in Consul

The Consul integrations for all LaunchDarkly server-side SDKs use the same conventions, so that SDK instances and Relay Proxy instances sharing a single Consul store can interoperate correctly. 

The storage schema is as follows:

- There is always a "prefix" string that provides a namespace for the overall data set. If you do not specify a prefix in your configuration, it is `launchdarkly`.
- For each data item that the SDK can store, such as a feature flag, there is a Consul key-value pair where the key is `PREFIX/TYPE/KEY`. `PREFIX` is the configured prefix string. `TYPE` denotes the type of data such as `features` and `segments`. `KEY` is the unique key of the item. For example, a `KEY` could be the flag key for a feature flag. The value is a serialized representation of that item, in a format that is determined by the SDK.
- An additional key, `PREFIX/$inited`, is created with an arbitrary value when the SDK stores a full set of feature flag data. This allows a new SDK instance to check whether there is already a valid data set that was stored earlier.
- The SDK may use additional keys starting with the `PREFIX` string, so you should not assume that the `TYPE` values mentioned above and `$inited` are the only possible keys. But the SDK never adds, modifies, or removes any keys in Consul other than ones starting with the `PREFIX`, so it is safe to share a Consul instance that is also being used for other purposes.
