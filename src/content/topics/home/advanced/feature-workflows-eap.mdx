<CalloutDescription>

Access to this feature is currently limited to customers who signed up for the [Early Access Program (EAP)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJ5qCC_RZTW9pPSXVZk9HaKzpltNAeoQb2t6gh7dLicwQWQQ/viewform). LaunchDarkly will continuously launch incremental improvements and more functionality as part of the EAP.

## Overview

With Feature Workflows, you can elevate your use of feature flags by creating complex workflows within LaunchDarkly. Workflows map to how your teams build, ship, and control software. You can also define custom release strategies that seamlessly integrate LaunchDarkly with your organization’s existing tools and processes, so every team can benefit from better feature management.

Feature workflows start with three powerful building blocks: **scheduling**, **approvals**, and **metric checks**.

<CalloutTitle>Feature Workflows are available in the LaunchDarkly API</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

All of LaunchDarkly's features are supported by API endpoints. To learn more about the API and supported endpoints for Feature Workflows, read the [API documentation](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/reference?showHidden=7f3f4#introduction).

## Scheduling flag changes

Scheduling flag changes allows you to define and schedule changes to your flag’s targeting rules for future points in time. While this sounds simple, it unlocks the potential to create a progressive delivery strategy by scheduling the incremental steps to release your feature to 100% of your user base.

For example, you may want to schedule the feature to turn on for internal testing two days from today, then enable it for your ‘beta’ customer segment four days later, and finally start an automated rollout from 0% to 100% over the following five days. Now you can define this feature workflow ahead of time and be confident that it will take effect at the specified date and time.


## Benefits of scheduling flag changes

1. **Timing an early launch**: LaunchDarkly users no longer need to set reminders or wake up early to turn a flag ON. Scheduling your flag to turn on on a specified date/time allows you to plan your release and let LaunchDarkly do the rest.
2. **Progressive rollouts**: Using this functionality, you can schedule your flag to roll out to 20% of your user base tomorrow, 35% the day after, 50% the day after that, and increase that percentage until it reaches 100%. This only requires creating a set of scheduled changes to your flag once and lets you slowly release features and ensure they’re performing the way you hoped they would.
3. **Changes to user access**: You can now schedule rules that target certain users and segments to be added to or removed from your flag’s targeting to better manage user access.
4. **Flag hygiene**: You can schedule your flag’s targeting rules to clean up once your flag has been rolled out to 100% of your users, to practice better flag hygiene and more easily understand the flag's configuration. 

## Scheduling flag changes

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>You can only schedule some flag actions</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Currently, the only supported flag actions that can be scheduled are:  

* Enabling/disabling Targeting, 
* updating the Default rule, and 
* updating the OFF variation. 

The **Schedule Changes** option only appears if your flag targeting changes include at least one of these actions. If you try to schedule flag actions for which scheduling isn’t supported yet, the unsupported actions will not take effect. Only the supported changes will be scheduled. 

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

To schedule flag changes:

1. Navigate to the flag dashboard and select the flag for which you want to schedule targeting changes. The flag's Targeting tab appears.
2. Make the changes you want to the flag’s targeting.
3. Click the dropdown next to the **Save changes** button and select **Schedule Changes**.
