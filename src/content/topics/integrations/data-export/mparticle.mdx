## Overview

This topic explains how to create and test an mParticle destination for data export.

mParticle is a customer data platform that allows you to aggregate your analytics and create customer cohorts.

## Prerequisites

To set up an mParticle destination in LaunchDarkly, you will need:

- Your mParticle server to server key
- Your mParticle server to server secret

The key and secret are available in your mParticle account. Copy and save both strings. You'll need them to connect mParticle to LaunchDarkly.

## Creating the mParticle destination in LaunchDarkly

You can use the LaunchDarkly UI to create and modify destinations for data export.

To create an mParticle destination in LaunchDarkly:

1. Navigate to the **Integrations** screen.
2. Click on the mParticle icon or, if this is not your first destination, click the **Add Destination** button. The "Create a destination" screen appears.

![The Integrations screen.](../../images/mparticle-add-destination.png)

3. (Optional) Enter a **Name** for the destination.
4. Select an **Environment** for this destination to receive events from.
   <Callout intent="alert">
     <CalloutTitle>Environment settings are permanent</CalloutTitle>
     <CalloutDescription>
       You cannot change an environment after you create the destination. If you wish to export event data from a
       different environment, you must set up another destination.
     </CalloutDescription>
   </Callout>
5. Select an **mParticle Environment**.
6. Enter your mParticle **Server to Server Key** in the **API key** field.
7. Enter your mParticle **Server to Server Secret** in the **API secret** field.

8. Select a **User identifier** type from the dropdown. Choose from the following options:

- customer_id
- email
- facebook
- twitter
- google

![The User identifier dropdown.](../../images/mparticle-user-id.png)

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>Choose the correct user identifier for your events</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>
    The user identifier you choose must match an identity you chose to identify users in the mParticle ecosystem. Every
    event LaunchDarkly exports has a user key specified by the SDK. The user identifier should correspond to the
    mParticle user identity your SDK user key represents. For example, if your user key represents an email address, you
    should choose `email` as the user identifier. To learn more about exported events, read [Schema
    reference](/integrations/data-export/schema-reference).
  </CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

10. Click **Save Destination**.

The mParticle destination appears in the "Your data export destinations" section of the **Integrations** screen.

## Testing an mParticle destination

After you create an mParticle destination for data export, you can confirm that it's working correctly in the "Create a destination screen."

To test the mParticle destination:

1. Navigate to the **Integrations** screen.
2. Find the mParticle destination and click **Edit**. The "Edit destination" screen opens.
3. Set the **mParticle environment** to `development`. This allows the test event to appear in the events stream on the mParticle dashboard.
4. Click **Send Event** in the "Send a test event" section.

5. Verify the event appears on the mParticle events live stream.

## Example events

These example events display the structure of the events LaunchDarkly sends to mParticle.

LaunchDarkly sends events in the following formats:


<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="feature-event"
  values={[
    { label: 'Feature event', value: 'feature-event', },
    { label: 'Click event', value: 'click-event', },
    { label: 'Custom event', value: 'custom-event', },
    { label: 'Page event', value: 'page-event', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="feature-event">

```json
{
  "user_identities": {
    "customer_id": "example_user"
  },
  "environment": "production",
  "events": [
    {
      "event_type": "custom_event"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="click-event">

```json
{
  "user_identities": {
    "customer_id": "example_customer"
  },
  "environment": "production",
  "events": [
    {
      "event_type": "custom_event",
      "data": {
        "source_message_id": "###-##",
        "event_name": "click",
        "timestamp_unixtime_ms": 1579630914337,
        "custom_event_type": "navigation",
        "custom_attributes": {
          "project": "project",
          "environment": "environmentID",
          "version": "1",
          "key": "click-event-key",
          "selector": "btn",
          "url": "http://example.com?queryParam=this"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="custom-event">

```json
{
  "user_identities": {
    "customer_id": "example_customer"
  },
  "environment": "production",
  "events": [
    {
      "event_type": "custom_event"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="page-event">

```json
{
  "user_identities": {
    "customer_id": "example_customer"
  },
  "environment": "production",
  "events": [
    {
      "event_type": "screen_view"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Enabling data export for flags and environments

After you create a data export destination, you must start sending flag or environment event data to it. You can enable data export for individual flags, or for all the flags in an environment.

To learn more about exporting event data from flags and environments, read [Data Export](/integrations/data-export#exporting-event-data-for-flags-and-environments).

## Deleting an mParticle destination

You can delete a data export destination from the **Integrations** screen.

To delete a destination:

1. Navigate to the **Integrations** screen.
2. Find the destination you wish to delete and click **Edit**. The "Create a destination" screen opens.
3. Click **Delete Destination**.
