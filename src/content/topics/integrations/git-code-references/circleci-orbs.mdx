# CircleCI Orbs

## Overview

This topic explains how you can use the `ld-find-code-refs` utility with CircleCI to automatically populate code references in LaunchDarkly.

## Prerequisites

To complete this procedure, you must have the following prerequisites:

- A personal API access token with `writer` permissions. To learn more, read [Personal API access tokens](./api-access-tokens).
- The LaunchDarkly [CircleCI Orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs).

## Setting up the LaunchDarkly CircleCI integration

To set up the LaunchDarkly orb in CircleCI:

1. Save your personal API access token as an environment variable titled `LD_ACCESS_TOKEN` in your CircleCI project settings. To learn more, read [CircleCI's documentation](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project).
2. Create a YAML file in CircleCI with configuration including LaunchDarkly's Orb.
   Here's an example minimal configuration using LaunchDarkly's Orb:
   [block:code]
   {
   "codes": [
   {
   "code": "version: 2.1
   orbs:\n launchdarkly: launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs@0.5.0
   workflows:\n main:\n jobs:\n - launchdarkly/find-code-references:\n proj_key: $YOUR_LAUNCHDARKLY_PROJECT_KEY\n repo_type: github # can be 'github', 'bitbucket', or 'custom'\n repo_url: $YOUR_REPO_URL # used to generate links to your repository in the LaunchDarkly webapp",
   "language": "yaml"
   }
   ]
   }
   [/block]

## Additional configuration options

You can learn more about configuration options in CircleCI's documentation. To learn more, read [Explore Orbs / launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs](https://ld.click/CircleCIOrbs).
