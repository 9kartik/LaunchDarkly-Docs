## Granting access to specific environments and flags

This example policy allows members of the QA team to administer environments tagged `qa_*` and manage flags in environments tagged `qa_*`.
[block:code]
{
"codes": [
{
"code": "[\n {\n \"effect\": \"allow\",\n \"resources\": [\"proj/*:env/*;qa_*\"],\n \"actions\": [\"*\"]\n },\n {\n \"effect\": \"allow\",\n \"resources\": [\"proj/*:env/*;qa_*:/flag/*\"],\n \"actions\": [\"*\"]\n }\n]",
"language": "json",
"name": "QA team policy"
}
]
}
[/block]

## Granting access to kill switch features, but not flag rollout or targeting rules

This example policy allows members of the ops team to kill switch features on the production environment. They may not change percentage rollouts or targeting rules, or manage any environments or projects.
[block:code]
{
"codes": [
{
"code": "[\n {\n \"effect\": \"allow\",\n \"resources\": [\"proj/*:env/production:flag/*\"],\n \"actions\": [\"updateOn\"]\n }\n]\n",
"language": "json",
"name": "Ops team"
}
]
}
[/block]
